Everything starts from a dot. The #Russian #painter and #graphic #artist Wassily #Kandinsky was one of the great masters of #modern #art, as well as the outstanding representative of pure abstract #painting (using only colors and forms) that dominated the first half of the twentieth century.

In 1922 Kandinsky became a professor at the #Bauhaus (a #school of #art, #architecture, and #design) in #Weimar, Germany. His art from about 1920 to 1924 has been called his architectural period because the shapes he used were more precise than before. There are points, straight or broken lines, single or in bunches, and snakelike, radiating segments of circles. The #color is cooler, and more subdued (softer, quieter).
