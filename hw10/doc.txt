map the entire music file in bins, like a histogram distribution of decibles

30 bins

music is 60 to 120 decibles and tailored range to the specific min max of each music file

the amplitude of each bin is determined by how many bits of data is in that time frame for 60 frames a second...changes while it rotates

visual interpretation of data in 3D

==

obviously , you can program music, but we decided to import different genres of music to show the variations in how the distribution and amplitude changes per music file
