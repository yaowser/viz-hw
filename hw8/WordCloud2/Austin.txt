can always live hick town like taylor buda pflugerville lower class coming suburb full east austinites trying move consider austin stay west 35 bottom line ive living austin four years now courtesy austinite husband originally come nyc lot plusses city namely climate laid back lifestyle lower crime rate compared major metropolitan areas especially like people anything else never really whole weird thing also quite minuses people really need consider namely public transportation system completely expect spend gas dont live central downtown downtown area lacking housing department woefully lacking things youd see downtowns like movie theatres every two blocks meseums mile tons grocery stores big box retail will drive theres traffic even live central expect spend thirty minutes get work thanks snarling traffic major highways people think austin cheap housing used thanks transplants like treated real estate like trips mall average home price cheap will making less paid elsewhere austinite husband commented average home price way high salaries im talking average joes im sure big money software developers etc dont share struggles can feel texan though watches priced right home courtesy property taxes crime lower side esp comparing austin place like nyc time typical city crime stereotypes often incorrect people hear nyc say ooh lot crime happens people unfriendly according 2009 city crime rate rankings crime happens austin cities nyc less crime national average people austin unfriendly rare people will ask life interestedfriendly unless want something trying sell
