Comments/advise on this topic or any other that might help my relocation go smoothly are greatly appreciated. I would also like to relocate and one of the options I have is Seattle. However I have never been to Seattle. Ugh, read the news headlines from regional papers or websites and get an idea of how creepy this place can be. The person who posted as a life-long resident has probably the most realistic view I've seen from a Seattleite. Yes, it is gloomy from November to spring. But not intolerable. The spring and summer more than make up for it. after a few years here you don't even notice the damp, grey weather, as a matter of fact you look forward to it. Yes, Seattle is pretty, there are nice people, but if you are constantly doging the weather, it's just no fun. ): Energy: Considerably low. I blame the hipsters, for their nonchalant attitude. Downtown is dead by 12 on weekends. Art, theatre, opera, symphony, music of all kinds and food galore also make Seattle a great place to live or visit. If you are interested in Seattle, don't let all the bitter posts change your mind. Those people live in EVERY city. Seattle has a little city complex. It has tried (and keeps trying) really hard to lift its status to a tier 1 city. Living within the City of Seattle gets you lower utility rates. Gas heat is cheaper than electricity here, so try to Nanny state culture: Seattle tries to regulate minor things, yet lets convicted felons run untracked on the streets. a very warm welcome in resturants if you ask for a table for one. In one particular instance at a resturant the staff If you look at the statistics, which locals regard proudly as positives, they do not illustrate the city's negatives.

There is no tax on groceries, but there is a 9.2% tax on prepared food and "entertainment," and an 8.8% tax on goods. The weather in Washington is mild compared to other cities, but you get just enough of it to fully enjoy every season. http://seattle.about.com/od/realestateneighborhoods/Seattle_and_Tacoma_Housing_Information_and_Neighborhood_Profiles.htm I think there are so many positive things to say about living in Seattle. 1. The air in Seattle is very clean and fresh, 2. Our summers are wonderful, not too hot or cold, stays light out until nearly 10:00 pm, days cool down quickly at night 6. Seattlites really care about the environment and our city government makes it easy/desirable to recycle household waste But for myself, I am going to move to Arizona or back to California in the next few years, as soon as I can sell my house.

Many things get left half done or left undone, with the contractor/service person unresponsive. and although people are polite..... they are distant. In other words they tend to keep themselves to themselves and I would Where I grew up I knew all the people down my street. You could wave to them and say good morning and they would wave back. Although on paper, Seattle is a good place for singles, I have found that it is a very family oriented city. You may not get It is VERY difficult to get into any social circles here. Most people I've talked to only have, at most, two friends outside member said "....did you say a table for TWO ?" in a desparate hope that she heard wrong. With a reluctant scowl she found a and although people are polite they tend to keep themselves to themselves and I would descrive them as "politely unsociable". Please send any information helpful in relocating to the Seattle Area. Queen Anne, or Belltown are the areas in Interested in. Yeah it does tend to rain 8 months out of the year while hovering in the 30s and 40s which makes the rain bite into you a bit. Seattle predestrians say they have the right of way; and this may be so, but if you are run over by a car you could end up dead. The Pike Place Market is a great place to visit. Check out the local talent on the streets and the vendors for gifts and things. There are no extremes in the weather condiditions in Seattle. Summers are dry, mild. Winters are wet, mild. Overall very mellow. There are so many single people here. I think they prefer to be alone. I have not met a guy here that I want a relationship with. Believe Me, The Other Man's Grass Is Not Greener. If You Don't Have Much Money, Prefer Sunshine And Like Seasons, Don't Move Here. I grew up in the UK and knew all the people down our street. You could wave to them and say good morning and they would wave back. Anyone considering a move to Seattle, please read some of these "Seattle is great" posts and get an idea of what the locals are like. Seattle is a very clean city, has fresh air, little crime, and the people are polite. However, IMHO Seattle is a boring place to live When it's sunny in Seattle there's no place more beautiful. Trouble is you waste away under dull gray skies 9 months out of the year. Homeless problem: expect to be harassed by homeless people when you walk down the sidewalk. Many of these people are also mentally ill. However, if you try and do that in Seattle, they would think youre crazy and give you a strange look and speculate what criminal motive However, if you try and do that in Seattle, they would think you're crazy and give you a strange look and speculate what criminal motive What is the best area to live (including suburbs)? Is public transportation reliable? Is it hard to find a job in the insurance industry? you have. Seattlites treat strangers as either (a) criminals - who wish to do them harm , (b) sex preditor - recently released from prison All in all, Seattle is just like a lot of other big cities; stressful, but good if you have a positive attitude and some bucks in the bank. It is an extremely intellectual and educated city; lots of thinking heads, but has no heart. I need both. This is not a place for dreamers. If you live in the tech industry you will have a wonderful time here, otherwise, expect to be priced out of comfortable living in this city. In one instance the first year I was in Seattle I'd just returned home from shopping and was parking my car in the apartment complex carpark Seattle has a great variety of things to do. It's small town living with big city amenities, and lots of big nature right in your back yard. Maybe it's the water, maybe it's just part of pioneer culture, but woe unto thee if you criticize this city within earshot of certain locals. My friend who lives just a mile up Cap Hill has often had ice and snow when I only have rain due to the nearly 500 foot increase in elevation. Seattle doesn't have the best climate, culture, or economy, but it is good enough in so many areas that it seems like a great all-around city. Thank You in advance for your kindness in helping me with information describing your favorite neighborhoods in Seattle (or surrounding area). Toxic work environment: very insular and self-serving office culture -- not specific to one company or the other, seems a general regional trait. It is a shame that we have a tolerance for the type of crime that affects all people and is being allowed to grow like a cancer in our communities. Need heat? Four seasons a year? Don't move here. Can you hibernate in the winter or can you at least be cool that over half the population here will? Seattle predestrians are not that good either. They would walk right in front of oncoming traffic without first looking, with their heads bowed down. There is too much traffic and winters do get boring with all the rain and grey skies. But the springs and summers and fall are mostly wonderful, mild. when I saw two caucasian females walk out of their repective apartments. They spotted eachother and then immediatly shot back inside their apartments. In another instance, I was taking an evening class; and when it finished I talked to the lecturer for a few moments before heading out to the car park. Seattle is not the utopia some locals claim. Ironically, they most likely do not want you here but prefer that you "admire their great city from afar." The people here are passive-aggressively hostile and unfriendly. Many of them are not from here, and because of this have no real friends from Seattle. Seattleites are generally very open minded- "live and let live". They are also ranked as one of the friendliest cities and as having the nicest drivers. There is no other place like the Pacific NW. You either love it or you don't. I happen to be in the camp that doesn't. It just wasn't a good fit for me. Beach in the summer (Alki), mountains for hiking or skiing, boating, museums, the aquarium, shopping, dining on the water, etc... you just can't beat it. I just can't say enough about the city or the area. True, it is full of liberal tree hugging socialists, but if you can look past that, you will love it. I moved to Seattle for work, and otherwise never would have ventured there. If I hadn't been forced to move for work again, I would still be there today. It is still nicer than many places, but defintely not what it used to be. It's also very dark in winter. Summers are absolutely perfect but way too short! Seattle is like San Francisco but more spread out and less vibrant- because of the WEATHER. It simply doesn't have the same energy because of the WEATHER. I can't wait to dump my overpriced home and go back to where people are friendly and sincerely care for one another (and that would be anywhere from here). - You have Starbucks, but there are many independent coffee houses such as Uptown Espresso, one of my favorite places to read a good book. (On 4th and Bell) Granted, everyone has their own personal experience, but you hear it from so many people in this city you wonder if there is something in the air and water. Seattle has very long winters with gray and drizzly days. Summer are short and typically only arrives around July. The best months are August and September. I failed to mention Mercer Island. This city is anthe island. It is upper class about 5miles to Seattle connected by a freeway. Houses like start at $650,000 Moved to the area several years ago, and I'm finally getting out. I've fulfilled my obligations and finally free to go. I cannot wait, and let me tell you why. Moving to the US from UK in 3 weeks time. My husband currently works in Seattle but I would like to move to Texas. Looking for some comparisons for both places - You have the opera, theater, orchestra, and almost any genre of music you want to hear. (Pioneer Square is a good place to go for Jazz, and many other bands.) I've lived in several states, and always made friends there. (The many friends I made during my 6 year stay in Ohio wrote to me for over 10 years after I left!) Note: the information shown here for Seattle is INCORRECT. It does NOT have 152 sunny days per year. It's more like 58. We have about 155 days of RAIN per year. I am mixed heritage Black and White. I have three children that look Black and 1 that looks White. My husband is White. There are a few African families maybe 3. Like grey skies? We got 'em 9 months a year. Slow drizzle makes for exquisite slop in which to schlep upon the obsolete infrastructure. Bring your million$ baby! he countryside about 20 miles outside the city consists of endless forest land with all the outdoors enjoyment that comes with mountainous, heavily treed terrain. If you're in to dark, gray, depressing weather then you'll love Seattle. It probably rains 80% of the time. It sucks! Invest in a good umbrella... You'll need it. Imagine an old flowerpot that has sat out in the rain for a decade. The plant inside has thrived and its roots are expanding, cracking and warping its containment. My evaluation is that Seattle is over-rated in several areas. I am looking forward to moving soon. I wakeup everyday and remind myself that this is only temporary. They respond to any criticism by blaming it on "Californians" who've moved here (not true -- I've lived there too)! Heed my advice and stay away! You've been warned! You just feel sick buying a house for a million that is a cracker box and was only 500k a couple years ago, because of Old Seattel money and new found hi-tech money. Just commenting on the constant delays and infantile financial planning that has gone into the latest Mass Transit relief project, the Monorail, er... now light rail. In my opinion the thing about Seattle is the scenery outside of the city. Drive 40 miles east to the mountains for some of the most beautiful areas you have ever seen. All in all, it's definitely a more interesting cultural experience compared to where I once was in the Midwest, but I still long for something more exciting and social. There are drawbacks: traffic, a pricey housing boom, homeless problem, rising cost of living, & tax levies (including a large public transportation levy for light rail). I lived in Seattle for 34 years and worked downtown nearly all that time. I know the downtown and surrounding areas very well and feel I can speak fairly about the place. In general, the weather here is not bad, it just gets very depressing having day after day with no sun breaks, but you get used to it, or on anti-depressants and move on. Seattle drivers actually drive faster, don't ask me why ??? Also in the busy rush hour traffic, if you are nice enough to let someone into your lane they rarely thank you. from her apartment did so and then proceeded to get into her car and drive away. What I don't understand is why people here in Seattle are so afraid of eachother ?????????? REI clothing is the standard uniform for most people, which I love; there are very few restaurants that will treat you any differently in that than if you were wearing a suit. After a while one was brave enough to exit her apartment and get into her car and drive away. After a few short moments the other female thinking it was now safe enough to exit Seattle has Puget Sound, Lake Union, Lake Washington and a few other lakes. When it is clear, you can see mountains. Very lovely, great parks, great views, lots of things to do. Housing is pricey and getting worse, jobs are pretty abundant - Boeing, Microsoft, Amazon, Starbucks, REI, UW, and a host of innovative entrepreneurs and mid to small businesses. People don't seem to want new friends. They will do everything they can to ignore you short of being hostile, although this is becoming more and more common everywhere these days. Here's what I observed, and these are the positives and negatives of the city and surrounding suburbs. They may not be in your mind, that’s why I am leaving it up to you to decide: I like Capitol Hill (gay people, hipsters, and nightlife) while others may prefer more trendy Belltown, cozy Ballard, quaint Wallingford, charming Ravenna, seedy Pioneer Square, etc. Seattle drivers are bad. They never seem to bother to indicate which direction they want to go and expect you to yield for them. Seattle drivers, when they see an amber traffic light A serious drawback is the cost of living, specifically property values. There are plenty of good paying jobs in Seattle though in contrast to the town I that I am from in the Midwest. -Stays relatively mild all year round (typically 40-50 degrees in the winter, sometimes dipping below freezing, 50-60 in the summer, sometimes going into the 70's or above in the summer). This is the same behaviour everywhere. If you are in a mall and open a door for someone, most of the time Seattlites will walk straight through and will not thank you or even look at you. You may find it difficult to live in Seattle 9 months out of the year if you're from a warm climate. All the stories you've heard about the rainy weather in Seattle are true and then some. Seattle has a very abstract unfriendliness and passive aggressive culture its veneer of politeness. For validation, look up a Seattle times article about "The Seattle Freeze." It's spot on. Seattle is beautifully green,diverse and for the most part it is economically healthy. However, it's mostly cloudy and the people that live here prefer to drive than invest in mass transit. Environment: One of the great things about Seattle is that you don't have to go far to find nature. You're right next to Puget Sound, there are an innumerable amount of park and hiking trails. In summary, if someone was to ask me if I would recommend Seattle as a place to live I would say NO. Seattle is only good if you are unsociable in nature and and want to live the life of a hermit. Yes, homeless people are a problem if you live in the city. You will no doubt trip over one in your doorway. It's a fact of life in a liberal town - but at least it's not as bad as San Fran or DC. The Seattle area has some of the best Doctors and hospitals. If healthcare is a concern, this is a great place to be. If you have to pay for it yourself, like everything else here..lit's expensive. Most People here tend to be:(statisically speaking) neurotic,artistic,intelligent,educated,introverted,tolerant and liberally inclined politically.If that's not you don't move here,you won't like it. Back to nature -- on days you can enjoy it. Seattle is a very scenic area, which draws fist time visitors in. Summer (Jul-Aug) is really the only time one can consistently get out and enjoy it, though. Like many Seattleites, I actually love the overcast skies and mist. It never gets uncomfortably hot or humid in the summer and the winters are very mild in comparison to many other parts of the country. I have lived in many cities all over the world, but was born and raised right here. It's true, we do have a lot of grey skies, but it just makes you appreciate the beauty of Summer and Fall so much more. I love going to Mariners and Seahawks games, especially when they play my Denver teams. Seattle has some of the nicest stadiums I've ever seen in sports and the fans are much better than you might think. Traffic through the downtown areas are a nightmare during most times of day, and the Washington State Department of Transportation has publicly stated that traffic congestion is not one of their concerns. HOw does one survive here? You are constantly waiting for the next GREAT, sunny day! Then when it is sunny, the rusty, pastey people run out get burned up and soak up all the Vit D until the next sunny day.. Also, Seattles traffic conjestion gets worse and worse by the month. Pretty much stop and go highway traffic from 7:20 till 9:30am then 10:30 till 3:30pm and of course 4:20 till 6:10pm monday through fridays. I am considering relocating to Seattle in the fall. I have been considering to move for a while now from the east coast. I am trying to gain information as far as the job outlook and what the economy is like. I've read some of the reviews here... and I'm a little astonished. My experiences here in the Emerald City have been terrific. I have HAPPILY sunk anchor in Seattle and am completely delighted to call it home. I think that for younger people Seattle can be great. By the way, the prices of housing units, though still higher than some places, have gone down in this recession. It's much more affordable to live here now. Can anyone offer any advice or help to help us with a decision? Any suggestions or advice will be greatly appreciated. I should also add that I have 2 young kiddos so great schools are extremely important to us. Seattle is a very self-promoting area, where the locals are defensive toward any perceived criticism of their city. Don't be fooled by the statistics, however, there is an intangible unpleasantness to the place. Seattle thugs should all be put in a rehab program to learn how the rest of the country -especially Texas - naturally interacts with kindness. It would be a blast of newness for these hard core very mean idiots. Seattle is a city of subdued excitement. It does not have "mega" anything. Seattle has great clubs, underground music, funky fashion, loooots of cute restaurants and cafes...(These are the things I appreciate)... In a nutshell, Seattle natives HATE invaders. We don't want you here - anymore than we would want the neighbors dog to use our lawn as a toilet. We will not make friends with you. We already have our native friends. Cons: Real estate values in Seattle are always appreciating. So it’s harder to find a place to buy. Socially plan on taking about a year to develop friendships. Just be patient, keep a good attitude and stay hopeful. Seattle is definitely one of the most beautiful places I've been to. The mountains that surround the city are breathtaking and you're never more than 30 minutes from either lounging on the beach or skiing down a slope. Yes its true, people here are very private. Some people are happy with their friendship circles and don't want to expand but I have lived here for five years and have made fantasic friends @ work, school, and the like. Hello, my family and I are thinking of relocating to Seattle. Can anyone tell me if there are any suburbs around that are more affordable with good schools and low crimes? Anywhere within 30 miles will be fine...Thanks. Drug use, particularly hard drugs like heroin is on the rise as is the 'homeless' population who are frequently not the laid-back sort but the junkyard dog sort. They're drawn here by Seattle's 'homeless outreach' ethic. It rains all the time, the nightlife is pathetic, and the cost of living through the roof. I don't mind spending the money if Im getting something for it, but I can get bad attitude from people much cheaper other places. I am a retiree in search of a neighborhood that is safe, affordable, has ample public transportation, walkable sidewalks and easy access to fresh markets that have a good variety of vegetables, fruits and wholesome foods. City services are much more reliable in the city. When the power goes out, power is usually restored in less than half a day. If you are in the suburbs, it can take much longer - over 2 weeks after last winter's windstorm. I think the people in both cities are so interesting and friendly for sure. I also think both places will bring something different to the table and will be really different from the southwest area where we currently live. My husband and I chose Seattle for a short trip to use up some frequent flyer miles that were about to expire. We have almost finished raising three great kids, and need to start finding our way again "just the two of us". Rents will always be different than what the websites note~ call the apartment communities directly or get someone to do it for you. But! stop being fooled by low rent rates they are not low and they will continue to rise. I love Seattle and the Pacific Northwest; however, the weather is too overcast for me. That's too bad because there isn't much else that I would change. If you have seasonal affective disorder, this is not the place for you. After five years in metro Seattle, I moved to another West-Coast city. I have never been so glad to get out of a place in my life, and I've been in a few pretty dismal places. I’ve never “lost touch” with “friends” so quickly. Yes, it's overcast here often but the temperatures are MILD. I have lived in Puerto Rico where you sweat as you towel off after a shower and Wisconsin where talk about gaining weight because you can't do anything in the winter! Not that it has, per capita, higher crime than other cities its size, but the crimes in the news here are just weird and more disturbing compared to other places -- seems like there are more sickos in this area than is the norm. I agree with another writer on this thread: it's a city with brains, but no heart. I have been wanting to leave for years, but haven't been able to afford it. As soon as I can, I will definitely be moving and I will never look back. We stayed at the Crown Plaza Hotel downtown and visited Pikes Place Market, the entire downtown area, Bainbridge Island, and we had such a wonderful time. The weather there is great. It's a nice change from the desert where we live. With that said, I lived in Seattle for 12 years, 8 of which were in the Denny Regrade area. I worked in Belltown and walked to work daily. For those of you who are reading this post, the areas I mentioned are in the heart of the city. Also, does everyone in Seattle feel that wearing anything but grey or black is a sin? Or does your recycled microfiber artificial fabric clothing from REI not come in any other color but earth or tree or pavement or abyss or emptiness? Seattle is a decaying city surrounded by lush greenery and, on clear days, impressive views of the surrounding mountain ranges. The city infrastructure is falling apart and it's governed by a niche-interest pandering, inept bureaucracy. If you are a liberal: and think you're escaping the conservative areas for more enlightenment, think again. Seattle's brand of liberalism manifests in Nanny state, soft on serious criminals, legislative gridlock, and pandering to the mos People are generally polished and keep to themselves. What people say is true: it can be somewhat difficult to make friends, especially if you don't have an job that inherently attracts social people (like bar tending or nonprofit work). When most people move to a different city or place they bring their attitudes, prejudices, and culture with them so there is going to be a clash of cultures. Seattle may not be the most welcoming city especially in comparison to the Midw Remember, Seattle is a 'Sanctuary City' and is actively opposing any Federal efforts to being it into sane legal compliance. The crime and increasing grittiness of the once-friendly suburbs is testament to that and other Seattle policies. As for the RAIN- it's not that bad! Yes we get rain. Yes we get a lot. But, again I have lived in the pacific northwest all of my life, and find that I would rather live in a place where it rains, that in a place that doesn't get ANY rain. My final comments- where else can you go hiking in the morning in the cascades or the olympics, then kayak the strait of juan de fuca or puget sound in the afternoon, then go to a restaraunt where they serve some of the best seafood around? Sounds like a lot of money and it is but the quality is not really there unless you live in Medina and that would mean your house is worth at least $1,000,000. Great shopping and food. Some up scale clubs if your into that. Several churches Bottom line is that liking or disliking Seattle is subjective, indeed. However, the locals tend to boast often, disdain criticism, and argue very emphatically that their city is the greatest and that anyone who disagrees is welcome to leave. Other neighborhood attributes could include easy accessibility to community theater, cinemas, restaurants, community centers, libraries, good cell phone and internet reception, bowling lanes, parks, good views, sports, music venues, etc. etc. You make some great comments about the third world. That is why I am moving out of the Bay Area. I am moving to Seattle, but cannot comment on my experience yet. All I can say is stay out of the Bay Area if you do not want third world living. and a lot of good places to eat. Salty's for a waterview (expensive) or Alki Crab & Fish with the same view and a lot of change in your pocket. Cafe Flora for vegetarian meal within a sunroom type setting. Vivace on the hill for best coffee!!! It's a great place to be, though I don't recommend living here unless you're fairly well off or don't mind running into the many hipsters and young trendy couples with 2.5 kids. They are rampant in this town, especially in condo-ridden Ballard. It is cool, cloudy and drizzly 9-10 months of the year - that's non-stop - as in gray skys and NO sunshine. With no friends and you stuck inside for 10 months, you will become severely depressed just like the vast majority of the other invaders. I guess if you are a fan of the fur, Seattle is a great place to be. Not so much of one myself but I had to write this because I was fascinated when I found this out. Been trying to encourage one of them to come to work in suit, that would be XD!! It can be difficult to get to know people well initially, but continued efforts to be social will pay off, you just have to find the right niche. Go out and do what you like and you will meet like-minded people.It's really not rocket sceince kids! I have lived in Seattle most of my life. The best houses and safest place to live is Issaquah, Kirkland, Mercer Island and Bellevue. They are all suburbs of Seattle. Bellevue is more of middle class metropolitan area. Houses likely start at $450,000 Seattle is a nice and comfortable city to live in. I think the main downside is the difficulty making friends and having relationships compared to other places I've lived. It would be a nearly ideal city if I were settled down and in my late 30s on. And then you have the hostility of the Seattle natives. The people who were born and raised here, and have called this their home for all of their life. We HATE the invaders. We give them the cold shoulder, ignore them and avoid them like the plague. Seattle is a great city -- Mountains, the Puget Sound, great shopping, the arts the art, sports, great schools, the worlds second largest ferry system, island hopping, great food, super entertainment and mild temperatures. What more could you ask for? Also, don't be naive about the traffic. The beautiful bodies of water (Puget Sound and Lakes Union and Washington) compress the freeways and traffic into and out of the city is a nightmare. This is a concentrated population with no mass (train) transit. With Microsoft, Nintendo, Boeing, Weyerhouser,etc residing in the area one should expect Seattle to be a very corporate city and that is what it has become. Social service programs are poor and the city is quickly becoming one of the have and have-nots. I have lived in the Seattle area for about 25 years now. I love the natural beauty here, but the people are another matter. I have yet to make a single friend. The same is true for my husband, and for several other people I've talked with over the years. - You have many excellent restaurants, such as the Tom Douglas's Dalia Lounge, Etta’s Seafood, and one of my favorites the Palace Kitchen off of 5th street. There are many more to choose, from lesser known restaurateurs, nonetheless, they offer varied dis Yes, Seattle beautiful in the summer (what day will it fall on this year?) or all other times if you like green mold growing on the pavement, sidewalks, side of your house, stairways, walkways, or black mold growing on the inside of your windowsills, etc. -Yes, the weather can get pretty depressing especially starting from around November to March. To offset this, I would take a vacation to Mexico or somewhere hot and sunny to get my Vitamin E "fix." After my vacation I would be fine the rest of the year.  But, with all that, I still can't imagine living anywhere else. I like being able to walk to a beach on the sound to watch the sunset as the sun falls behind the Olympics and take my daughter to one of the three parks within walking distance! Life is good! The important thing to keep in mind is that everyone is going to have their own experiences and that they are going to base their opinion on this perspective. I moved to Seattle from the Midwest about a year and half ago to be closer to my dad and brother. Don't expect to find on-street parking in the downtown Seattle area. Several Mayoral administrations have actively pursued an anti-car agenda and have essentially embraced gridlock as part of their strategy to 'get people out of their cars'. The voters love it. Traffic can be horrible, like any big city. If you can wrangle it, live in town and just don't drive! Downtown is a ride free zone, and the trolley will take you from Myrtle Edwards Park to Pioneer Square. For me, that meant a one dollar ride to Mariners games! It is possible to get around in Seattle without a car. The public transportation is not spectacular, but cna get you around. Check out the city's transit website, and you can get where you're going. I have lived here for 2 years without a car, and don't miss it. If your hobbies don't include a lot of boating, skiing, or other outdoor activities, then you may find the area boring. If you're in a situation where you'll depend a lot on meeting new people to build a social network, then you may find yourself very frustrated. I've lived in Seattle since 79' with the exception of a few years in Hawaii and the weather here is horrible. Mostly cloudy and gray year round, summers can be nice but never enough sunny days. People live here because of other qualities, weather isn't one of them. So, is Seattle going to make everyone happy?... clearly not. If you aren't enjoying your life here, I'll side with the person who stated earlier you should leave as soon as possible and find the right place for you. To me, that place is SEATTLE. I love this place!!! To the people that say it rains all the time, I appreciate you spreading that message because it helps keep our touristy areas manageable, simply because if people knew how actually beyond gorgeous it is here The Underground Tour and the Space Needle would be over run! The rain does get depressing after a while, which is about the only reason why I'm considering a move to San Diego, but I still think I'll stay around here. It's a beautiful place with a ton to offer and if you take some chances and risks, I think you'll love it as well. Do you think that the people here are really that bad? We have noticed that there is some distance to people here, but we just figured it's because Texas is just really, really friendly, out going, naive people and not so liberal. I guess you trade one things for another? I was born and raised in Seattle and pretty much continuously lived there up until '96 when I married and moved out of state. I fully intend to move back. I visit at least once a year so I have been keeping up with the situation there. In thinking about the pros and cons: You’d better already have a job when you move here. Trying to get one once you move is difficult unless you already know someone in a company. Techie people make decent salaries here. A lot of other people do not. Salaries and the cost of living are very disproportionate. But seriously...there are some great companies here to work for, and some smart people here. It might be a good place to live/work, for you. Very diverse, there are good reasons to live here. Just not if you like a fast pace, a warm climate, fashion, style, or friendliness. It seems to me that you tend to give safer big cities, such as Seattle, a higher crime index than more dangerous small cities, such as Santa Fe. I got this impression from the Frommer's travel books. Personally, I'd need more therapy to be brave in Santa Fe than in Seattle. I absolutely love Washington! If anyone is interested in moving to our beautiful green state and has any questions about it - I am also a licensed real estate consultant and can help you with questions on relocation or any questions you may have about a certain city in our area. Seattlites are rude to you once they learn where you've come from. People in the Midwest (where I live after leaving Seattle) are rude because no one ever taught them otherwise; the phrase "Excuse me" is very, very seldom heard and practice of the concept behind it even less so. For 30 years I have lived in Seattle and love it here. There are no deep snows, no dehydrating sun, fresh air to breath, tons of beaches, outstanding restaurants, and people that are relaxed (except for some of the status-seeking East Siders and financially stressed South Enders). I have lived in a number of different cities across the USA mostly on the West Coast. I currently reside in LA. From reading other’s posts, people are trying to convince you if the city is bad, or not. Just lay down some of you own observances, and let people decide for themselves. Before you chop my head off, let me explain. I had always wanted to move here since I was small, to the Pacific Northwest. When that opportunity came in the form of a job in a very specialized field, I jumped at the chance. I didn't come here with anything but love and an open mind. Seattle doesn't get heavy rain except in the winter months. Its mild- not ever really extreme. Just lots of dark clouds that mist rain for weeks on end. It kinda of sucks. I, like many, complain about this OFTEN but then summer comes... and I fall in love with Seattle all over again. As for the earlier comment that most Seattleites only have two friends outside their family...well I feel bad for you that you are so unsociable or repellant that you were not able to make new friends or meet new people. I meet new people and make new freinds reguarly. It is QUITE EASY! I like that I can go camping, run on a beach that is not crowded, explore nature, and still be cultured, and have all the conveniences of the city. We have the most beautiful library in our downtown Seattle and our library system is excellent with generous and current books for lending. I'd love to live in Seattle, with its acres and acres of natural beauty, mild seasons, and TONS of rain (I love gray skies and rainy days)! The only problem is, I don't have buckets of cash. So, perhaps Olmypia or Tacoma or another nearby--and less expensive!--city would suit me better. The only other thing is that I moved here from DFW and things tend to be a little crampt and claustrophobic for me so I am still adjusting to that.Everything and everyone tend to be so close together-if you need wide open spaces and and lots of room to be happy this is not the place for you. This Is What Happens When You Read That A City (Seattle) Is Rated The Best Place To Live. It Is So Expensive Here. You Need 3-4 Roommates Working Full-time To Make Ends Meet. And It's Either Raining Or It's Cloudy All The Time. God Forbid Should It Snow Because The Entire Area Will Shut Down. The people are the worst. Seattle, get a grip. Lose your attitude. You are losers. Get over yourselves. Texan friends, people in Seattle are the rudest and truly stupidest (what is with their low IQ?) people I have ever met in my life. Enlightened = Austin people. Thugs/stupidity = Seattle people. Summers are wonderful here, highs in the low 80's and sunny skies. But you might enjoy only 8 weeks or so of such weather. The rest of the year is cool with a light drizzel, interupted by occasional sunbreaks. Winter is mild though, with temps below the 30's pretty rare. The air is very clean here. I'm planning on relocating to either Seattle or the Twin Cities. Right now Seattle is winning, so to speak, but I'm a bit concerned about the climate. I enjoy a brisk winter and a warm summer - so how often does it snow in Seattle? And what about the summer - does it ever really warm up? Thanks! Joe Culture: Lacking. This city has little passion when it comes to the arts, visual and performing. If you're not an art connoisseur or a hipster, you'll feel out of place at art galleries, and if you're not interested in producing indie or grunge music, you'll have little audience or support in Seattle. Also, think about this saying a place has a laid back lifestyle sometimes is a nice way of describing laziness. Things get done in their own time, with a quality goal of "good enough" around here -- if you're used to a fast pace or efficiency (East Coast people take note), this might grate your nerves. Seattle is a charming city. It's safe, clean, and there is a lot of natural beauty (hills, lakes, and mountains very close). The weather is mild, the summers are beautiful, and chances are what you've heard about the rain is greatly exaggerated. It has darker winters, but overall the climate is very nice. cities in the country. Mountains to the west and east, a volcano to the south, and surrounded by water on a clear day it's stunning! And that's where some folks get hung up, clear days free of cloud cover are rare during the winter. But, when the sun pops out ones appreciation for the beauty is heightened. Yes it is true, while the good days are excellent, the temperatures moderate, but, there are few 'good' days. Perhaps less than 80 or so, that can be called Sunny (not the partial afternoon sun that we are used to and get excited about, but full on sun). Can't hardly grow a tomato with the short summer. :P I also like the easy access to outdoor recreation. Being a born and bred Colorado native, I enjoy hiking, skiing, fishing and other types of outdoor recreation. Seattle has easy access to all of these things and the climate stays pretty mild all year long, so you can stay active even in the heart of winter. Plus, since moving here, we've been shocked by how many people come down with various serious diseases (MS, cancer, etc.)--the rates are extremely high. I'm convinced it's because there's almost no sun here--hence, no Vitamin D. We take supplements every day now, but I still think living here is a health risk. -Yes, the weather can get pretty depressing especially starting from around November to March. To offset this, I would take a vacation to Mexico or somewhere hot and sunny to get my Vitamin E "fix." After my vacation I would be fine the rest of the year. The winters are very mild in Seattle, compared to the East Which is OK if you make $80k a year, but most of us don't. Real estate prices and rents are making this an elitist city for the rich. Sure you can find cheaper housing outside of Seattle, but, lets face it, the commuting into Seattle has always been a problem and who'd really want to live in some of these places? People here are generally polite and reserved, but distant. As a new resident, it can be difficult to make connections, as Seattleites pretty much keep to themselves. They seem friendly and polite on the surface, but it seems extremely difficult to make plans and get to know people beyond that surface interaction. Seattle has gotten way too expensive for the common man. Due to the state's high gas taxes Washington State now has the 4th highest gas prices in the nation and the 7th worst traffic. Costs keep going up more than salary increases. Unless you work in a high paying sector, don't come here. I'm making plans to exit. The schools curriculum is top notch for students. That is the reason why I moved here although I don't like my son's teacher. Apartments rentals start at $900.00 but can increase to as much as $2800.00. I have a 3 bedroom apt 2name bathroom and medium quality apartment and the rent is $1545.00 plus water and sewer Seattle has a Hispanic population that makes up 6.6% of the population! Not 0%! That's about 40,000 Hispanics and if you've been to Seattle and haven't seen that, just go to South Park! It's FULL of Hispanics! I believe around 40% of the people in that neighborhood are Hispanic! This website gives false information! Seattle's no longer a sleepy little town. We're growing and thriving. Go online and read all the articles about our booming economy and all the jobs we're bringing in. The stats show that unemployment here is among the lowest in the nation. Check the job websites and you will see a variety of positions in all fields. Seattle is a very beautiful place with plenty things too do(hiking in the mountains, swimming on the beaches,plenty of shooping malls and outlets,plenty of resorts,plenty of sporting venues and awesome dinning. A great place for an interracial family. Not as rainy as everyone says it is, does have plenty of cloudy days. The cost of living is high, and transportation is at the $2.50 per bus ride (and climbing) mark. Rent is high, though still reasonable for a large city (about $900-$1500). There is also a lot of petty crime, and rising violent crime. Traffic is getting worse, so prepare for a commute whether you're in a car or on the bus. Before you are tempted to yell "xenophobia!", let it be known that Seattle natives are not frightened of other cultures. Seattle is, and always has been, a culturally diverse city. It is a matter of too many people being crammed into a small area, and the precipitous drop in quality of life as a result, that is the problem. I agree with Ken. People are hiding behind "Spirituality" instead of choosing Religion as an excuse to not have to face reponsibility for consequences of their actions. I rather live in a city and country that fear God than those who are threatened by God. If you want to live where people are "spiritual" move to California. Seattle has poor air quality, especially in winter when many people burn (wood stoves, fire places)and air is stagnant. Many believe with all the rain and cloudiness that King county and Snohomish County have good air quality, however, check statistics on EPA "Airnow" web site, air quality is one of the worst in the country. Look, I don't want Seattle, or its suburbs to grow any more dense than they already are, and I certainly don't want to lose the Seattle I admired as a kid. However, being antagonistic and spiteful towards outsiders doesn't solve anything. The greater Seattle area is my home now, and I'll continue to think of myself as a local. They All have good jobs but where is the most friendly and laid back they all have their cons like Fargo is small and many ppl told me nothing happens their i also heard about the seattle frezze.In addition in Salt Lake are High Home prices.Can you please tell me the overall feel of this cities even a warning will help thanks. Winter days are short. Dark at 5 p.m. Summer days are long with dusk around 9:30 p.m. Seattle has a very temperate climate. Winter's lowest temperatures while I have lived here (since 1995) are in the 20 degree Fahrenheit range. Average range of winter climate is in the 30s. Summer highs are around 75 and sometimes in the 80s. Some may argue that the California Bay area has everything that we have here and more. It is much bigger there, but they lack the nature we have here. We still have beautiful lakes & rivers that don't require a multi-hour drive out of the city to get to. And the trees, they're everywhere! It makes the city look fresh and alive. Seattle is known to be a rainy place but in reality it is the gray skies that are dominate here. Rain is usually little more then drizzles, sprinkles,heavy fog, or a mist. Most people who live here don't use umbrellas. If it is raining hard enough to warrant an umbrella it is probably windy too which makes the apparatus useless. I relocated to Seattle from North Carolina in 1994 with no more than a Mazda full of my most treasured possessions. The prices were a bit of a shock at first. Even toilet paper, which is manufactured here in Everett, is more expensive in Seattle than in North Carolina! It took me a couple of years to figure out how people manage. Rent was also a shock. When I left, I had been renting a two-story townhome in Raleigh for $325 per month. In Seattle, I moved into a one-room "studio" apartment with a slum landlord for $525. However, my utility bill for electricity was dramatically lower. In the end, it all averages out. I later moved to a cheaper part of town. Weather - terrible for nine months out of the year. Dark, gloomy, overcast, damp, rainy. Summer is for two to three months. I don't remember the fall season, other than rain. It doesn't rain hard and stop. Not usually, its more of a continuous drizzle and dampness for months on end. I'd rather have snow. It rains from Oct. - May. As I approach 30, my husband and I are considering starting a family. I have no idea how we can afford to do that in Seattle or anywhere in the outlying suburbs (which are no less expensive). We are both working professionals with degrees - the whole thing. But it doesn't matter. Seattle is just too expensive. It is heartbreaking. And yes its true, the weather is DREARY. It goes like this: Cold, damp and grey October through May. Warm, sunny, and breezy June through September (except this year June is chilly). Some people really don't mind the chill and can handle grey drizzle 8 months out of the year. They know the summers make up for it (short as they are). My husband just accepted a job in Seattle and we plan to move in the next few months. What I really want to know is whether this is a good place to live. What makes Seattle special and what suburbs should a family be looking to put down roots? I want a "feel" for the place, numbers and ratios only cover the tops of the trees. Thanks It saddens me to see so many people from out of the area have moved here, THAT is why our traffic, parking, prices, etc. have gotten so bad. In the 70's this was still as affordable as it is beautiful place to live. They chop trees down now like they grow as fast as your lawn. Out of state drivers don't know how to drive in the rain. My husband and I just found out that his job will be transferring him to either Seattle, WA or Portland, OR. Both of us have lived in Phoenix all our lives so this will be quite a change. I should add that we are looking forward to meeting new and different people and experiencing new things to do that will be different from Phoenix. I hope to be accepting a job in Seattle soon, But Does ANYONE have anything good to say about the place. I shall be moving from the UK, and what I have read on this site is not encouraging. If you want to whing about poor quality of life, crap schools, hospitals, transport, overcrowding rude, dirty, crime ridden places, come to the UK. Seattle is very expensive for what you get (look at the median home price of over $400,000). The traffic is terrible. You can be stuck on the freeway for hours. It used to be a nice place. Like so any cities, it has been ruined in the past few decades by excessive growth. There are many natural areas but lots of traffic to get to them. Seattle is not what most people consider an overly friendly or outgoing city (though residents are more open to all types of people than most places). By February or March people tend to be hunkered down and, yes, depression is quite common. This is nearly the ultimate test of how one does with light depravation. I know this first hand. You have many wonderful activities and sights to see and experience. We were very taken with the mixture of forest and ocean there. We felt a kind of rugged adventurous spirit there in the air and with the people. Being from New Mexico and loving Colorado, we fell in love with your city. We plan to come back and bring the kids sometime. It's really is not for me.. I like to wake up to the sun..it give me energy.... the rain, makes me down.. and makes you wanna just stay inside and not go anywhere. This is NOT a way to live.. IT is spendy here too.. So, YES, I am planning my escape. I have lived in Scottsdale, Santa Barbara, LA... I don' know where next. I must research. HOUSING: Seattle may be less than San Francisco and New York but don't be fooled, it is getting expensive. If you have kids and want a neighborhood where they can play, you will either need to plan on living far enough away from the city, where you will be commuting, or you need to make $200k/yr to live closer to the city in a "nice house". Perhaps, my fellow ex-Midwesterner, you simply haven't met the right people. Also we only attract what we are, and when you love yourself and can laugh about your own differences people will laugh with you, not at you. Welcome to Seattle, by the way! :o) I hope you begin to see the beauty that surrounds you, in the mountains and the people! In 1979 Bill Gates and Paul Allen decided to move their merry little band of tech dorks from New Mexico to Seattle. Shortly thereafter began the introverted nerd invasion. The presence of so many invading nouveau-rich out-of-towners completely changed and ruined Seattle. Cost-of-living and congestion skyrocketed. Quality-of-life was plundered. School quality is an issue in Seattle and they are generally not as good in the suburbs. But if your kids can get into the Spectrum or APP(enhanced learning programs), they are actually better than what suburban schools offer. We also like the cosmopolitan nature of the Seattle which allows our kids to get to know kids from other nationalities. But sadly, I have witnessed an economic squeeze that has become uncomfortable - even unbearable. The cost of housing has recently jumped from really high to totally out-of-reach. Gas is so ridiculous that it took us over 4 months to unload our 4Runner on Craigslist. It takes nearly $60 to fill a Maxima. Meanwhile, salaries just aren't keeping up. It's a good place for LGBT folks. There are enough gay people here to where you won't really have to worry about homophobic discrimination as much as elsewhere. Anyone here who does have anti-gay views is usually more quiet and calm about it because they know they have to be around gay people anyway. So in that sense, it's a safe place to be gay. My husband and I had originally planned on moving to Seattle just for a few years for work and then going back to Vermont. Now we're so in love with it we decided to stay and raise our family here. Don't listen to all the naysayers on this page...the truth is that the weather here isn't any worse than a lot of places, and it has so much to offer. I am 25. I make $30k a year and share a 1 BD that cost $1000 a month in the heart of Capitol Hill, a ten minute walk to downtown. I have a car, a parking space, make enough money to buy the things I want, party, and save up for vacations too. My favorite US cities to visit are NYC (Brooklyn!!!), New Orleans, San Francisco, and of course Portland <3 I feel bad for the good people who came here to get involved in the music or art scene, or were duped by "Singles", or for whatever other reason they came to start a new life but were punished by the social disease here. It butts people away and shuts people down, turning even the bright newcomers into another face in the grim shadows of this city. I am one of those people. I was born and raised in Oregon myself, but every time I visited the Seattle area / Western Washington, I always thought of myself living there someday, because it was like coming home. After 30 years, finally I got the chance to move up here for my career (yes, I'm a techno geek, and no I don't care what you think of me.). You see, it's very simple. Seattle used to be a great home - 25 plus years ago. Most of the people living here were native to Seattle. Seattle was a large city with a small town feel. High quality-of-life, low congestion and low cost-of-living. Yes the weather sucked, but we were used to it and really knew nothing different and considered it normal. If you are an artist or intellectual introvert, for example, and want to be left alone, this is your place. Your neighbors probably won't say much more than "Hello" and your coworkers won't invite you over for dinner. But if you like to enjoy life and feel included, don't let Seattle crush your spirit. Profit from the hardship and mistakes of others. I've also found the local people to be strange: they are smug, they like to quote statistics and promote Seattle as the "best place to live bar none" -- if someone says something negative, they'll pick a place in the country that's worse off than it is (those poor people in Kansas, dealing with tornados, for example, or Detroit or Philadelphia, etc). With this said, we've chosen to remain in Seattle proper rather than moving to the suburbs. Right now, my commute is about 4 miles from work. It takes me 15 minutes on average, 10 minutes on "good days." You may have to settle for a smaller house and yard, but at least you have time to enjoy it when you get home every day (rather than just weekends). I have read that many people move to Seattle only to leave within a year or two due to the gray and rain. A close friend and long time resident left Seattle for Denver, missed Seattle so much his family returned and bought a house in their "old neighborhood”. A year later they realized they simply couldn’t do with SO LITTLE sun and returned to Denver. Let me repeat my title, Why you gonna lie, seriously?! I just moved here from Indiana two months ago, not far from the previous post about Tennessee. Seattle is a haven for artists, liberals, free thinkers, fun lovers and flat out hippies--rich ones! We have Microsoft, Amazon, Boeing and many other fantastic companies that pump money into our economy. The people are friendly, and I found it very easy to make good friends. There are so many parks and recreational sports leagues, it is easy to enjoy athletics. Seattle is the place to be if you enjoy an active lifestyle. Biking and rollerblading are SOOOO great in the many many place built just for it. Picnics at Green Island are a great way to unwind! In responce to the post regarding religion in Seattle I have to sadly agree with the original poster. There are alot of people in Seattle that are religious but not spiritual. They stand on their mighty thrones and and proclaim how religious there are but many times they are worse than non-christians. They don't follow the spirit of their relion at all. our regional traffic issues restrict flow of goods and services through the local economy. as roads are more packed, consumers decide not to venture even the shortest distances to seek out products and services they desire and need. while seattle has many wonderful livable characteristics, this economic issue is playing out in the local service economy. That being said, if you're into outdoor activities and sports, there's pretty much anything to do around here that you can think of within an hour's drive. There are quite a few excellent, astonishingly-overpriced restaurants in the city as well as in surrounding neighborhoods. The symphony is good as is the theater scene, especially gay-themed theater. There are many, many hills, which is great if you want to work on that killer ass you've always been dreaming about, and awful if it decides to snow or get icy. It is rainy and gray a lot, and when it rains, it is often mild and halfhearted rain that drags on for days at a time. Load up on vitamin D if you want to save yourself from seasonal depression. Try not to make assumptions on daily life here based on human interest statistics like "most dog friendly" or "most literate." You may get tired of these people and their dogs everywhere (like in the supermarket) -- you may also find "most literate" means a lot of people with their noses in a book or pointed at their laptop instead of talking to anyone. Lots of people from other regions are lured to Seattle and the Northwest because, unlike many other parts of the country, the natives promote their city, its culture, and its benefits rather than criticize it. To someone from another region, this good press + some nice pictures of the Sound and mountains make it look like a really attractive place to live. Seattle really has everything you'd want from a metropolitan area: good food, entertainment, good pro sports teams (lately), views of water and mountains, trees/ plants/ wildlife, & tons of outdoor activities all within a short distance. Plus, good public schools in many neighborhoods & the University of Washington, ranked 9th best University in THE WORLD. Like someone pondering the meaning behind a cat’s smile, I expended a lot of energy trying to get beneath the surface and to take my organization deeper. But I’ve kind of concluded there is nothing behind the smile. Really. Nothing. It doesn't mean anything at all, good or bad. And people will have a hard time with you if you think there should be anything deeper! Well, after two years, we're ready to leave. Yes, it's still beautiful, and yes, the housing costs are lower than in California, but the weather can be really hard to take. This year was actually a good one--lots of sun from May-September, but the two preceding years were awful. Day after day of gray, rain, and snow. No summer in 2008--just a few weeks of sun in July. I've lived in the Seattle area for 11 years. It's very diverse, as there are many different races/cultures. However, if you are a person of color that is looking for a mate/companion of your same race; do not move to Seattle. I've have had NO luck in finding a mate of my race (African American). People of color in Seattle tend to date/marry someone of a different race. When I came here from California in the early 80's there was a huge recession going on and Californians were very much resented--much more than now. But, I met my husband here, an early Microsoft employee, and we started our own software company. I was young then, and what with the husband, the job, and some very nice friends we had, I did not notice the bad weather much. I grew up in Seattle and the rain did'nt bother me, I did'nt think it was that bad. Then I moved to a few different states(Florida, Alaska, Michigan, Utah, and Quebec Canada) and when I came back I could not beleive how much it rains here. In November my wife and I are moving to Boston; large in part because of the weather. I don't think I can handle another depressing winter. We also like having things nearby. There are many supermarkets and department stores in most neighborhoods, not to mention the many smaller shops if you need to look for specialty items. Restaurants and take-out places are so convenient you can even walk to many of them in many city neighborhoods. You can't get this much selection in close proximity if your are in the suburbs. We can't overlook the culture that Seattle has to offer, and the Emerald city offers a lot of it. Seattle has great theater and opera, and it is underappreciated. The seafood IS the best. Wild salmon makes for good eatin'. We have museums, good colleges, and some interesting neigborhoods (check out Fremont). The air quality here is good, and you don't need a car to get around. Racial diversity: Racism exists, as it does everywhere, but you cannot feel it as heavily because people are either more tolerant or more passive aggressive. There are a lot more mixed people and a lot less segregation than in a city such as Chicago. Unfortunately, there is a huge amount of gentrification in Seattle and many minorities are being pushed into neighboring suburbs. Seattle is a liberal city. Gay and lesbian couples hold hands and kiss publicly here without issue. Anti-war protests close down city streets. Everyone recycles. During the Solstice Parade naked people ride bicycles through streets of Fremont. I would say that a social conservative would find Seattle unsettling and the Capitol Hill district the very epicenter of moral depravity. I left paradise (read: Hawaii) and moved to Washington state with my immediate family when I was 12. To this day my parents wonder if they did the right thing because our entire extended family still lives in Hawaii and living island-style creates familial relationships with people we Seattlelites would regard as acquaintances simply because you can't escape people on the island. I live in Seattle, which I like to view as a small-town city. It is small enough to walk the entire length of the city on a lazy weekend day, but busy enough to keep you entertained the entire time. It's not a ghost town like Portland, or a frenzied heart attack like Manhattan. It's that perfect in-between. If you frequent any one place enough, you will be known by your first name. Yes it has gotten very expensive to live here lately. But I only make 3$33,000/year and have my own place- granted I live in the suburbs- Bellevue/Kirkland area, but its so close to seattle it doesn't make a big difference. It can be done, quite easily in fact!!! There are also many programs in place in King County to help people find affordable housing. ARCH being one of the best. I am looking to relocate to the Seattle area from the Southern US. I would like some local input on the best area(s)in which to live. I'm single, so school systems and such are not big priorities at this time in my life. I want to be relatively close to all the city has to offer though. I would have no objection to living outside of Seattle as long as a smooth commute would be possible. you said to comment on a topic. I've been born and raised here. Gone to church my entire life. My comment is that I have seen a growing hostilit towards those who choose to be a person of faith by those who see no value in such a belief system. It's become so bad that you almost don't want anyone to know you are a person of faith, for fear of retrubution. It wasn't this way 30 years ago. Severe churches. No nightlife. A few pro football players but we don't them and you will know when you see them because they stand out like a sore thumb. Crime is minimal. Washington state is looking to approve gay marriage on Tuesday. I'm against it and that was the reason why I was on the website looking to move. The communities I mentioned are all the ones I would be willing to live in I've grown up in the Seattle area and while yes, it's beautiful and green, it does lack in coming up with different and interesting things to do in comparison to other U.S. cities. Yes, plenty of skiing, hiking, and some good drives - but when it's Saturday night and you're past the bar/club phase, there's not much going on. Just something I've continuously heard from people around here... Seattle is a good home base for me. I love the cool, green and easy living, the beauty of the mountains, lakes, forests. I love the city and all the culture that is available. Great book stores. Intelligent people. I am an introvert and Seattle works for me that way, people do not get in your face. I love that all is available to me as great music, theatre. It is an easy city to get around. Hi All - I may be moving to Seattle from Atlanta soon and would like opinions on the general downtown area. I'll be working downtown and would like to live in an area where my 18 year old daughter can walk to shopping at nice stores but will also be a safe neighborhood for her. Can anyone recommend some areas I might try? Thanks in advance! If you need any information on Atlanta let me know! Even though I'd worked my way up to a mid-level job position, I had to start over at an entry-level job while I proved I wouldn't run back home with my tail between my legs. After about a year of working hard and showing my value, I was promoted within my company and finally made a survivable income. However, it took 3 years to get back up to the equivalent salary of what I was earning in NC. I am so thankful that my condo is downtown. This past winter has had floods, storms, high winds, snow, and ice. It's been terrible. But, luckily, I live downtown where we are sheltered from the cold temps and high winds because of our lower elevation. I have felt sorry for people (especially those who live in the suburbs) because they have gone over a week without power due to the high winds. It is my most favorite city in the country...if you have money to afford it. I lived in a condo facing Elliott Bay, which made it amazing. It is by no means cheap, so don't expect to live in a trendy area if you don't make close to or over six figures. In fact, I would say living in Seattle without making at least $50,000 would be miserable - which is sad, considering how liberal the area is. Don't move to Seattle if you have children, you will be disappointed as Seattle is a very un-family friendly place. Also, don't move to Seattle if you do not have lots of money. The people are nasty and unfriendly, the weather is either wet, gray, or ugly most of year. I am moving my family out of the area and to the Mid-West where people and services are more in line with reality. Say "WA"?..... Total expense is $1648.00. Each apt gets 1parking space and of you want a garage it will cost $150.00. Issaquah has lots of trails. It's a small suburb. Cultural diversity is limited White and Asian being the majority, a growing Indian population certainly more than Blacks which are 1% of the community. A small Hispanic community likely less than 1%. There are a few mixed race couples and children . I lived in Seattle after college and loved the beautiful scenery...when you can see it through the clouds and rain. It's a great area to live for outdoor recreation. But the traffic is horrendous. And if you like sunshine, forget it. The gloomy, grey, drizzly fall, winter, and spring seems like an eternity! Bottom line...beautiful place to live in the summer, depressing and dreary the other 9 months. On the very bad side, the people are lifeless, passionless, fatally introverted, cocky, rude, arrogant, and impossible to get to know. The streets are just filled with loneliness under the grey dome of overcast permanently covering the city. At first you think its just you as a newbie, but then you hear the same story over and over again from others. Do a Net search on "Seattle Freeze" and see my point. Being from the PNW originally, the weather was what I was used to, but actually RAINS LESS IN SEATTLE that Portland! I know, mind blown! But, Seattle is actually in a Rain Shadow cast by the Olympic Mountain Range. We still have tons of cloudy days, though. The Summer months more than make up for this, in my opinion, but I do always try and go somewhere sunny & warm at least once during Winter to recharge. Despite such density relative to the suburbs, Seattle still has a "small town" feel due to it's zoning restrictions. Unless you live along an arterial, communities close to downtown or bedroom communities such as Fremont or Ballard, there are still plenty of neighborhoods with plenty of "elbow" room around your house. There's enough personal space, but not so much that you don't get to know your neighbors. It's great that you can take public transport here. The bus system covers the city well and more importantly, the buses are safe and clean. Growing up in Philadelphia, it was inconceivable that you'd take public transport on a daily basis; it just wasn't safe or clean. When I lived in Raleigh, NC, crime wasn't a factor, but you really had to drive if you wanted to get around easily and meet friends places. PEOPLE: I think it is a mix of people who have been here their whole lives and transplants. People who have been here their whole lives have a ton of friends and contacts so it is harder for them to always reach out to transplants but people do it and if you are a transplant, you have to work hard at finding and building new groups of friends - but once you do, you will have fun and the city gets "smaller". Have been here since '91 and seen the town make its final transition from blue-collar burg to San Francisco North. The quality of restaurants, stores, etc has definitely been a boon, but the lack of adequate infrastructure, average/below average housing stock ($600K for a 1500 sq. ft, unimproved bungalow?, sorry the basement really doesn't count), and failing schools is pretty much driving out this family... I have been to the Seattle area many times (my parent live on Whidbey Island)and I think it's an amazing city all-around. I lived in Eugene, OR for about 4 months when I was in middle school and while there, I visited Portland for about 2 days. It too was a beautiful place but it seemed to be a bit slower-paced and not as hustle and bustle as Seattle. I was 13 during this point so it's a bit hard to remember. While the scenery is lush and green, it’s just not enough for us. The cost of living goes up weekly, and it is now right on track with living in expensive cities in CA. Traffic everywhere in the metro area is pretty much a nightmare all the time. The area did not plan properly years ago, and there is no light rail or other transportation besides cars and buses (except a very short train route N/S by Seattle). I've been here for 10 years and have loved it. I love that it's a big city, more is more analogous to a bunch of interconnected neighborhoods, which makes it feel a little bit more neighborhoody. This is one reason that I'm a bit sick of the small town feel to it. The winters are getting to me, though I do love the seasons. Perhaps it's just that 10 years is a long time for a 29-year-old to spend in one place. The good news about Seattle if you're moving here is, once your (and it's a different time period for everyone it seems) adjustment period is over, then you start to see and enjoy more of the positives, as you've learned to deal with local idiosyncrasies (including personal indignation over any criticism at all -- very defensive, passive aggressive beyond belief, xenophobic, and socially insulated people here). Seattle is a wonderful place. I grew up in a suburb and moved to West Seattle as an adult. The public school system is stellar, especially if you have a child who is gifted. The programs are the best in the state and are modeled in other districts - including Bellevue. I now live in a University town in California. The public schools here are as good as Seattle - however few places I've lived can make that claim. The city itself is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful cities in the country, if you, like me, enjoy a concentrated skyline that looms gorgeously above the landscape. The Space Needle, Pike Place Park, Gasworks Park, Seattle Center and other landmarks are unforgettable. The old neighborhoods near the city, where I mostly lived, are great but are more of a mix than most cities (beautiful homes next to dumps). T Personally, I've explored many types of churches: Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Catholic, New Age, Evangalist and the list goes on and on. Never have I been made to feel like an outsider. It's easy to talk to anyone on the street, but yes, I do reserve the long conversations for my tight friends. The closeness that we have fills my mind and heart. My friends are few in number, but very dedicated to my personal happiness. Why, you may ask, am I still here? Family obligations. I'll be leaving the city of my birth at my first opportunity. Seattle used to be noted for its friendliness...if you've ever been to The American South, you'll laugh at such a title being placed on Seattle. These days, Seattlites will be friendly if you're a very specific type of person. If you're not that type of person, don't expect basic courtesies or a smile. i have lived in seattle since 91 but i have lived on my owned since 99 and i do not like it and i am moving out of here soon the housing is ridiculous i was looking at a house and i sat a certian price and the real estate agent looked at me like i was crazy also and the cost of living is pricey not like new york or california but you have to have two or three jobs just to survive on your own who wants roommates i don't After many years of living a variety of places around the country, most recently in California, we moved to the Seattle area a little more than two years ago. We'd been here many times before on vacation or passing through on the way to Canada, and we'd always wondered what it would be like to live here. We loved the water, mountains, and trees; we also liked the educated population and lower (relatively) housing costs. Seriously, you need to visit for a week or two in winter before you move here—really, before you move. Winters are long, very dark and dreary. There is rain, but the thing that bothers most people is the lack of sunshine for weeks at a time. The cloud cover is like nothing you have seen. It is like dusk a lot of the days—during daytime. At least in other areas when you have snow, you get sunshine on the other winter days. Seattle is an amazing combination of city and nature. The two blend together in an amazing way, and the best way to visualize this is during sunset or sunrise when the amazing colors of the sky reflect off the modern glass high-rises of the city. The colors on a good day are very vivid, ultra-bright pinks, deep reds, vibrant purples, clear blue, and sometimes a little green. The sky on some days turns into one GIANT rainbow. I lived in the Seattle area since 1988, but it is too expensive to survive in here anymore. I am looking into relocating to a small town after my retirement in a few months. Can anyone recommend a safe town to live in Washington, Oregon or Idaho? I love the outdoors, don't like very hot summers, don't mind snow in winter and don't mind that much rain, neither. It is very important for me to live where there is not much crime. I'm sure once-upon-a-time, Seattle was what most long-time residents have assured me it is: "The Greatest City On Earth". I can't tell you if it's the influx of people that "ruined" this place or if they were content to be isolationists and hate the idea of people invading their beloved city. Either way the result is the same: A paradise for rich, white, self-centered liberals who, under the hood, have a very racist backbone. I was fortunate to have been raised in West Seattle on Alki beach. What a wonderful place in the 1940's, 50's, and early 60's. I now reside over on the Kitsap Pennisula far from the high prices, snarled traffic, condominiums, and declining quality of the school systems. The arts and entertainment in Seattle are still worth the trip, but I, as a born and bred Seattle native cannot beleive what has happened to a once Emerald city. I am contemplating moving to Denver or Seattle, from Alexandria, Virginia. Actually, I never really considered Seattle, until I read some of the comments. I do not really know who and what to believe i.e., there seems to be a wide range and varying degree of opinions, with respect to either location. I just wanted a honest perspective, without emotion. I will be working from home and looking to enjoy life and the surrouding area. The city I grew out of. Yes Seattle used to be the little town that could. Still a bit segregated, but real. Now everyone is from somewhere else, so the real sense of family and community is lost, so we see the Seattle freeze, where it is hard to meet others. I did youth mentoring for a mostly African American school, 33 mentors, on to two blacks, rest all white, no Asians, and only me from Seattle, everyone else from somewhere else. Traffic is horrible: I-5, I-405, I-90 at least are congested throughout much of the day, not just rush hour. Driving in the city is an exercise in patience -- crosswalks on every block, with undisputed pedestrian right of way (pedestrians in Seattle are also not in a hurry). Drivers are also passive-agressive, waiting at intersections for others to go when they have the right of way -- insisting (literally) that someone else go first. What a shame. I wasted five years because I didn't realize any of this - about Seattle or myself - before I agreed to go. As visitors tend to do, I bought into the image when I came for interviews. Unfortunately, I signed the contract. And soon I realized that behind the "friendly" smile there is a glum, self-centered, self-deluded reality. I think Seattle may be the most dishonest, emotionally repressed population I've ever run across. That doesn't mean that this positive view will be shared by everyone. A lot of people move here and are disappointed. The local response is usually to the effect of "love it or leave it." Many natives love this place because it's comfortable and familiar to them. There's a lot of "from here vs. not from here" mentality. If you're from California, for example, some locals will complain about "you people" coming up here and ruining the place. I love the area because there are 4 distinct seasons. Yes, some are longer than others, but we've got them all. And for each season, we have the activities you'd expect for them. We've got the skiing, the great outdoors for hiking and camping, wine country for tastings, great golfing (Newcastle Golf Course is likely the best in the region), sailing & plenty of water sports, etc. Fall is my favorite season. It's warm and sunny, but not too hot. I lived in Seattle for a few years and still love it there but everybody is moving there. I don't mind these from California but those from the east coast are nasty. They bring their bad driving habits. The drivers used to be polite and let pedestrians cross in the crosswalks but not anymore. These east coast drivers are clueless about crosswalk laws. I've been almost hit several times and the license plates were from Virginia and Pennsylvania. Seattle is a combination of urban business and retail, with neighborhood living and dining. It has unending options for different ethnic cuisines, local small business and real communities to live in. It does not have many nationwide chain locations - no Walmart or Olive Garden, although there is a Target and Starbucks/fast food is a given if you need those types of comforts. Amazing public transit system - a car is not a necessity in this city. There is also a lot of hipster competition and ass sniffing. The plus side of this is that it's a great place to get good music recommendations that are not top 40 or have supper somewhere other than Applebee's. But of course, there is a downside, too. For straight 20-35 yr olds, it is much cooler to smoke unfiltered cigarettes and be in a band than to work on a career (although the gay community seems exempt from this-- good for you guys/girls!). Pressure from succesful hi-tech millionaires and Many Seattle old money-inheritor's have pushed most out of the market to live in the most convienient and attractive places. For instance Bellevue-Kirkland, basically a suberb on the east side of Lake Washington, It will cost at least 750k to buy even a decent house. Of course if you go out further you can do somewhat better but then the traffic is horrendus to get to your job in Bellevue or Seattle. While it's unfair to Seattle to call it a "decaying city" on par with Detroit or other places that have fallen into disarray, it is dirty, has a homeless problem, lacks public transportation, city council and state government seem to have difficulties in reconciling public works projects. Seattle appears to lack the police and utilities services needed to keep the city running -- in the event of any natural disaster, this city is in terrible shape. I moved from Portland, Oregon to Seattle about 1 year ago. Before that, I lived in Detroit, Michigan. I told my friends I was about done with Portland and so bored. I had asked some friends about where they would suggest I could move. Portland is pretty, but it is a snore of a town and LILLY WHITE. I never felt comfortable there. Seattle is a very diverse and beautiful city. I love the much more diverse racial population in Seattle. I really love it! There have been a lot of comments about rude people here. I don't know where these "rude people" are coming from, but they weren't here 30 years ago, so they must be transplants. No place in the US may be friendlier than the South, but I'm not convinced that Seattle is a rude city. Traffic has gotten worse over the decades and the drivers may not be as nice as they used to be, but at least they will still yield to you when you're merging. Try that in LA. I have been reading comments from many different cities on this website and there seems to be a trend going on here. Most negativity posted here about individual places, fall across all cities: drug problems, crime, housing costs, people's bad attitudes, weather, political and social attributes, ect. - The more I read, the more I realize that the only way you can truly figure out if the city is worth checking out, is to actually go there and visit it firsthand. For the socially inclined, the Meet-up Groups have been very helpful. OK Cupid is pretty good for date-ups. Just google Burning Man Seattle to find a wonderful way to find cool parties with entertainment like fire spinners and acrobats. There are also a lot of sponsored team sports you can join in on, like volleyball tournaments on Alki Beach, or soccer at Greenlake. There is an extensive array of bike trails, and that seems to be a good way to meet new friends. I really love everything about Seattle, the culture, the coffee, the close mountains, the technology companies, but the rain is really draining. I think I have SAD. I've been here for 8 years and it gets worse every year. I need to take vacations in sunny climes every winter to avoid the blues. Even with a lightbox, a dawn simulator, an adjusted diet and excercise, I always feel better after coming back from a sunny place. If they can Move Seattle to Hawaii I'm there! Seattle and most of its suburbs are expensive, both in terms of the costs of housing and in the cost of government. In the latter case this is particularly true in terms of how poorly state and local government design, build and maintain the infrastructure. Top that off with a climate that can be depressingly wet and gray for a substantial part of the year, and a retiree, unless equipped with substantial retirement savings, can find it a rather limiting place to live. The one thing about Seattle I do like is the fact that you can live somewhere like Bainbridge Island or Bremerton, and take a ferry to work. You can live 30-60 minutes away, and still have the commodities of seattle and the big city like feel right at your fingertips. The schools in neighboring cities are a little better than Seattle's- but I think that's just because their not up for closures. There are too many schools, and not enough students to fill them in Seattle. From a retired person's point of view. Seattle has a lot to offer in the way of the arts, theater, and a variety of neighborhoods. Public transportation is especially convenient and inexpensive, especially in the greater Seattle metro area, for seniors - 50 cents even round trip within 2.5 hours. It is true there are fewer sunny days than in many parts of California, but also more moderate temperatures for those who don't like long hot summers nor very cold windy winters. On the upside the city is surrounded by beautiful nature with islands on one side, mountains on the other, forests, beaches, etc. You can find tons of good restaurants, from Malaysian to African to European and continental. People are largely well-educated and the area boasts fine educational institutions. British Columbia, Canada just a few hrs to the north, Portland to the south. People are very tolerant of individual thought, dress, etc, and very respectful of privacy. If endless gray, cold weather gets you down, don't move here--it can feel like a prison sentence. What's worse, much of the population seems affected by the weather--we barely see our neighbors for most of the year until they resurface during the summer months. It's depressing. You should look forward to getting up every day and interacting with the world; here, you wake up and just wish you could leave. I'm counting the days till we move again--scenic beauty isn't enough. I have been here for about a month from California. I know, another Californian. So far I really love this place. The girls are very beautiful up here. That really caught me by surprise, since everyone was telling me how "grungy" and unkept they are. Far from it. I love the coffee, the clouds, the rain, the sun, and the music everywhere. I was deciding between Seattle and Austin. Austin is still on the list, but so far I like Seattle. Seattle is very beautiful in many ways. We just visited here once, like, 2 days ago and have aleady decided to prepare to sell our house in Texas, which is too damn hot and lacking in diversity...and moving to Seattle, selling our cars, condensing to one....renting a small apt. and simplifying to we can have access to mountains, mild weather, our plants are shriveling up and dying. Maybe by a smallish condo in a slightly out lying area of downtown. Buying mopeds....just living a more active and liberal lifestyle. What kind of person would think that. Of course Seattle has clean fresh air and nice people. The person above is the one that is unsociable. I've lived in Seattle for six years now, and everyone is friendly. Don't listen to that cokeworm above. Aside from the phenomenal beauty and majestic skyline, Seattle has wonderfully kind people who are sociable. The reason why this buttplug above says Seattle isn't sociable is because he or she is the one that cannot make any friends. There are a cadre of people who wish to reclaim a Seattle "identity" but frankly they are such an absurd minority that the rest of the population ignores them so they can continue their splendid isolation. The rest of us continue to make friends with whoever we wish, recent residents or life long Seatilites. Please ignore whatever stereotypes these natives or self absorbed transplants make up, this is a city where you make yourself happy or miserable just like anywhere else. I've lived here all 21 years of my life, and I can't wait to leave. It's a beautiful place for anybody without a background. But if you just so happened to be a troubled child, they will for sure hold it against you for the rest of your life. I'm hoping to find a place to call home, have a second chance, and raise my growing family. My hometown is not the place I'll be able to do that. It's infested with drug addicts and whores. I am the 99% and Seattle is a 1% kind of economy. Not kid-friendly at all. Dog owners rule this place. Expect scowls and snarky remarks if you take a toddler out in public anywhere. Seattle has many older childless couples who treat their pets as their "kids" and are insensitive to the fact that a caring for a baby is not just like adopting a puppy. Child safety often disregarded (just read the local news, many examples of child abuse, neglect by local parents and repeat-offender predators out on the streets committing crimes). - You have many excellent restaurants, such as the Tom Douglas's Dalia Lounge, Etta’s Seafood, and one of my favorites the Palace Kitchen off of 5th street. There are many more to choose, from lesser known restaurateurs, nonetheless, they offer varied dishes and excellent food. These also have many bars included, and when dinner is no longer served become hang-outs for the bar crowd. Sushi, Indian, Thai, all types of ethnic food are available in Seattle as well; very diversified. The people here would probably call themselves "chill" or "relaxed". The reality: it is lazy. This is where old rich people go to die and young homeless people go to leach off of them. This city drags its feet while time marches on without it. If you want to contribute to the friction that holds society back, move here. The people here are bitter, angry, and frightened. They are also too meek and lazy to do anything about it. If you can't tell, I am a bit disillusioned by it all. Being a resident here since 1971, traffic in Seattle has been getting progressively worse. When we first moved here, one can get on I-5 and there was literally be no congestion whatsoever. Now, traffic is generally congested somewhere from 8 am - 7 pm on the highways and interstates. People generally don't like taxes here so the problem is not likely to be fixed soon, especially with the mayor's office predicting our population will increase by 100K (about 20%) in the next 10 years. I found the city very beautiful and far to lovely for just anyone (read: evacuees of Katrina, ect.) to move here. It is very expensive, but worth it just for the beauty and many offerings it has. It owes quite a bit of it's reputation to Grunge and Kurt Cobain, he made it what it is today, he really put it on the map! also, big thanks to Bill Gates, he really cares about appearances. It is a beautiful, strange, high-bred place, with mystical weather, so keep that in mind. I love it. Overall, I think it's an effect of the fact that Seattle is not encumbered by a very strict and structured idealogical constraints. It's great to not have to wear a suit every day and nice that preferring public transit to driving is not stigmatized. But it's pretty annoying when when you ask a hipster waiter what they do for a living and they say "working on a graphic novel" or when your date casually mentions that she used to be a sex worker and might get back into it. Oh, Seattle! There are too many junk food stops, but we like to stay in shape. Our homes cost too much, and our big homegrown Bank WAMU lost site of how to qreed is a bad thing by giving away money to poorly qualified borrowers. Now they are JP Morgan, and their stock is a penny stock. We have Paul Allen. He built a great Rock, and Roll museum aka EMP. It is awesome. We also Have Microsoft, and Bill Gates is leading a great example for his childern by worthy Charities in Education, and Healthy Care I have to say, I am very disappointed with a lot of what I have seen on here. I moved to Seattle from Vermont, and I absolutely love it here. The temperature is a lot warmer, and it rains LESS here than it does back in Vermont. Yes, it's true that the winters tend to be cloudy, but the rain is rarely more than a drizzle and there are still at least a few sunny days a month. The summers are absolutely amazing. Warm without being too hot and nothing but sun and clear skies for three months. I guess everyone brings their own experiences -- I happen to come from Houston (disgusting pit - and I was born there!), went to school and worked in DC (nice city that I enjoyed living in), lived in Dallas (not for me, but I understand why people like it), and San Diego (beautiful weather, tough to get anywhere in business). I have found Seattle to be the best combination of professional opportunity, cultural offerings, and friendly people... all wrapped up in a stunning natural environment. It is overcast most days from October to April with an occasional sun break. The cloud cover keeps the temperatures moderate in the winter for how far north Seattle is. I'll take a Seattle winter over a Midwest winter any day. While it does rain frequently, it is more of a mist-rain than a down pour. I think that the fog and rain creates a cool feel to the city not to mention keeps the landscape lush. The summers are dry and almost San Diego-like. Yesterday it was 79 degrees with a light breeze. Having lived in Seattle my entire life, I can attest to the many, many wonderful things that it has to offer. Every time I travel, one of the best parts is coming home to the trees, the mountains, the water, and the wonderful people that makeup the city. Nothing beats the pristine beauty, the logical and level-headed political climate, the appreciation for art, music, good food and of course good coffee. (No offense, Starbucks, but there are so many MUCH MUCH MUCH better coffee roasters in town). In all actuality Seattle has become a very pretentious place. Culture and the arts are very processed and another commodity to be purchased if you have the money. The Homeless problem is one of the worst in the country. People here tend to think "we" are "progressive" but Seattle has many social problems including a bad drug problem, high suicide rate, poor urban planning, and terrible traffic problems. Politicians only give lip service and the general feeling here is one of self-centered apathy. I have to say, after reading some of the comments made I could not disagree more. I was born and raised in Seattle and of all the things I like most about my home state it is the people. Everyone I have met is warm and kind and laid back. I love Seattle. I love the culture and the people and the nightlife and the dining. The only thing I dont like about Seattle is the weather some times and the terribly slow drivers. People in Seattle drive horrible! Other than that, I love everything about Seattle. Avoid all cities in the western half of Washington State! The hotels, restaurants and cab drivers will try to rip you off every time. If you wouldn't want to visit, why would you want to live there? The people are bizarre at best, obnoxious at worst. The weather is just as bad as you might've heard, all rain all the time. the cost of living in western Washington is outrageous, as many of the locals will tell you (which best explains why they try to rip you off-they have to in order to make ends meet). I've lived in Seattle for nearly 40 years. I came here to attend the University of WA, fell in love with the city and have been here ever since. The city and surrounding area are beautiful, with a mild climate, plenty of recreational and cultural opportunities, great healthcare, and good employment opportunities. The one negative about Seattle is the cost of living which is significantly higher than the national average. I guess that shouldn't be surprising since it outranks in so many other categories. Food and Drink: There are many great authentic Ethiopian, Japanese and Vietnamese places to eat. See a taco truck? Trust that it will also be authentic and delicious. (I am speaking in general terms. There are gems from alot of other cultures too, as with any major city.) The seafood is particularly superb. Also a bevy of cafes to choose from. And I mean, about five on every corner. Get learned in the art of coffee, and do it fast. This ain't no Dunkin' Donuts, so no ordering of "a large coffee" allowed. One comment on 'bestplaces.com' and their "comfort index". It clearly states "have you ever noticed that nobody complains about the weather being cold and humid" Umm, well, they must never have asked a place that gets cold and humid. :D. Just like a "dry heat", a "wet cold" is quite different. It may never get frigid in Seattle, but 35degF sure feels more like 15degF due to the moisture. Seattle folks complain about the cold at a much higher temp than others, due to the moisture sinking into their bones. I moved out to Seattle from a major city in the NE over 15 years ago - when Seattle was still liveable and agreeable. Over the past decade it has turned sour. I totally agree with other posts that alot of Seattle people (I've met anyway) are really rude, self-absorbed and myopic - so, Yes, I totally agree: lots of smart people here, but if you are a jerk what good is it? The 'Borg' mentality prevails: whatever you do, don't stay and be assimilated! That said: I am looking to leave here as soon as possible. Every new person moving here makes the already horrific traffic worse and raises what has become an unreasonable cost of living. You moving here will only intensify the problem. And no, there is nothing special about "You" that makes you an exception to the rule. You can't move here and "become" a Seattlite, or "join the club" as many have tried. We used to loath the California invaders, but since the invasion began we have expanded our sentiments to include people from every corner of the globe - literally. Real estate here is breathtakingly expensive, but you know that already if you've been researching the area. Expect to pay a minimum of half a million dollars for a very small home with a very small yard within the city limits and in a 'relatively good' neighborhood. For a 'comfortable' home with a proper kids-sized play yard in a 'relatively good' neighborhood, $850.K is not uncommon. Budget for constantly-increasing property taxes and little or no public opposition to any proposed tax increases whatsoever. The most beautiful (environmentally) city I've seen in the U.S., and I've lived in almost every state (except Hawaii and Alaska, which could give it a run for it's money). But (you knew there'd be one)it's too expensive. Housing is astronomical. You'll be house poor if you buy in Seattle and you are anything other than upper class to wealthy. It's not a realistic housing market for average people. The jobs don't pay what they should to off-set the cost of living (which is above the national average), either. I approach Seattle from the standpoint of someone who chose to move here rather than being from here. For full disclosure, I was moving back toward the neck of the woods I am from when I met my future husband and of course 13 years later, children, a pug, a home, here I am. I am a real estate broker in Seattle and often work with clients new to the area. I think I tell it like it is: the good, the not so good and all the things in between, including what you will come to appreciate and love about it over time. Discount wholesale grocery stores are a must! Join Costco or Sams. Shop at the grocery outlets. The minimum wage is much higher here which means that what is cheap elsewhere (such as it's cheaper buying groceries than eating out) is not always the same here. My grocery bill was about 1/3 higher for the same food. McDonalds has similar prices nationwide, so it was cheaper for me to buy a ready made salad at McDonalds than buy a bag of greens at the grocery store, plus all the dressings, etc., and make it myself. After 52 years living inside the Seattle city limits I have had a chance to experience the ups and downs of Seattle "today". Although our pace is not as frantic as New York City and our skies are not as sullen as those of San Francisco, there are a few things you must know. People are friendly in some neighborhoods, others they are frankly just too busy to be nice. And you can hit a sunny, bright blue sky one day and overcast with a drizzle the next (even in July). We have great parks, wonderful beaches (yeah, Alki!) I moved to Seattle after graduating from a Washington State college, Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA (basically Canada). I've been here for almost 8 years. Overall, I would say Seattle did take some getting used to as the residents can be a bit dismissive to newcomers (this is a generality, and not always the case, obviously). I was able to forge new friendships and relationships with people from the area, but it did take some time. People mention the 'Seattle Freeze' often, which is why I bring that up. It actually doesn't rain that much in Seattle, we just have a lot of cloudy days. But even that isn't too bad. The "blah" days start around mid-October and continue through mid-June but from mid-June to mid-October we actually have quite a few sunny and even quite warm days. We even tend to get clear days aplenty during some periods in December-February. And on these clear days, when one can gaze out at snow-capped mountains to the south, east AND west, geographically and climatologically, there's no place I'd rather live. I have never felt so at home since I moved here. Yes my 'twang' has been commented on and we've laughed about it. If you're conservative and not comfortable with diversity then you may not fit in well here--and I mean diversity--as people of every belief system, fashion sense, not to mention ethnicity and orientation live here. I think to live and love here requires a live and let live outlook, an acceptance of everyone (twang is included), an ability to carry on an intelligent conversation and a love and respect of nature. Seattle boasts a number of wonderful qualities: highly intelligent global citizens, beautiful natural mountains and lakes for recreational use, and an expanding citiscape with new shops and condominiums. The downside of this is that unless you are bringing in a substantial paycheck living anywhere near the city has become next to impossible. Microsoft has brought us economic stability, but is squeezing out middle class families. This maybe the current American trend, and certainly Seattle is a top tier city is this respect. The weather is mild- people freaked out that it got up to 100 a few days this summer :) But that is great- never too hot, never too cold. If you want snow- go to the mountains nearby, but you don't have to shovel your drive or put chains on just to get to work. Want sun? head to Eastern Washington for a weekend or even a day....but you don't get baked all summer long. Want to hang out on the water- great there is water EVERYWHERE! Spend money watering your yard- no need! It will rain a bit later so you can save that money :) I am one of the thousands of Midwest-raised folks who made the pilgrimage to Seattle (seems like every other person I meet here is from the Midwest). If you're from a sunny climate, you won't be impressed. But for those of us who grew up with harsh, continental climates, this is paradise. I can walk outside with almost no jacket one some days in the winter. I can run around outside for hours in the summer and not sweat a drop. It's definitely not as nice as sunny smooth Bay Area, CA but Seattle is probably the next best thing. Don't Walk! Run! Run! Run! To The Nearest Highway Entrance! I Moved My Family Here From The Mid-West Almost Twenty Years Ago. Since I Have Been Here Employment Has Been Mediocre. Rents Keep Going Up And People Are Not Friendly. It Is Really Difficult To Find A Suitable Mate Around Here, Particularly If You Are Female. All The Available Men Are Either On Drugs/Alcohol, Fresh Out Of Jail/Prison, They Are Unemployed, Have Anger/Control Problems, Their Credit Is Messed Up, Are Interested In Nothing But Playing Games, Etc. Etc. Etc. A city that has prided itself on individualism has sold out to corporate greed. Amazon, Microsoft, Google and other tech giants have changed this town to something else. It's just Techies (mostly Brogrammers), people with money and yuppies now. There still is some middle class, but they are struggling and likely don't live in Seattle proper anymore. COL is high, people can be cold to non-natives, and weather is not sunny for more than half the year. Come summer time, Seattle is beautiful, and many things to do and sights to see. Summer used to be from July 15 - Oct 15th, thanks to global warming, you will now receive some solid sunny days from June 1st. The last few winters have been pretty rough, cold, windy and rainy but if you are a skier/boarder, this is good news! You will get one week of sunny days that are really cold in mid January. You won't have a lot of encouragement from Dec 15th - April 15th, pretty much rainy or overcast. From April 15th - June 1, you have to just get into hobbies and focus on getting your cycling in on the "good days". :) Despite the low crime and laid back living, Seattle is fast becoming one of the most expensives places to live. I am born and raised here for the past 35 years and the living allowance hasn't increased in over 5 years, while the housing, gas, food, and taxes have increased. Thanks to the out of town buyers, I can't even afford to buy a home in Seattle! It is highly frustrating! I am looking elsewhere to settle down and buy a home...perhaps Ashville NC. Promising economy and affordable homes is what Seattle use to be 20 years ago. I'm looking at possibily relocating to Seattle from all the back from the East Coast, but I have never actually been! I am going for an interview in a few weeks and wondering if any of you residents reading this can answer some questions. What is the best area to live (including suburbs) if I want to work downtown? I've read pretty bad things about the traffic. What is going on with the public transit over there, is the monorail and underground bus systen really shut down? Are there shuttle services to suburbs like Everett or Redmond? We have had a couple of experiences with Carlos Velategui and they were definitely not good ones. We believe that he is totally incompetent and is not able to handle his responsibilities. My mother, who is an incapacitated person, has lost in significant ways due to Velategui's loyalties. We believe that she has lost several thousands of dollars because of his slanted choices. We believe that he should not be in a position of such power. Other elderly people will continue to lose respect and money because of this man. We are truly at a loss. There was a Seattle cultural identity that one was born into. A culture that was formed by a life long exposure to a peculiar climate and geographical isolation. This shared isolation forged life long friendships and familiarity with fellow-native idiosyncrasies, creating a culturally unique community. Seattlites took great pride in being different. You are either a Seattlite or not. And yes, this same social paradigm exists for all of the Seattle suburbs like Bellevue, Redmond, Issaquah, Renton, Kent, ETC. Basically the entire Seattle region. I re-read all this just to be sure I was telling the truth (I am) and not over-dramatizing things (I’m not), and I find myself just shaking my head thinking, "What a shame. What a waste." Beautiful place, but over-built metro sprawl. Smart people, with little love or empathy. Smiling faces sometimes, but fixed and joyless. Big ideas, but resentful of leaders. Lots of liberal ideas, but highly controlling, un-generous, arrogant personalities, demanding monochrome, religious adherence to those "liberal" viewpoints. Big city, but vacuous and empty. If you live in and work in the tech industry you chances are you know at least 1 or 5. Furries are a huge thing here in the Seattle and surrounding areas. They have meet ups all the time and even a convention called "Rain Furrest" They tend to be white middle to upper class guys. Most of winch are gay, although you would not know it unless they told you. They always are invading Capital Hill (gay district of Seattle). I had no idea util one of my co-works was talking about furries things...Turns out there are at least 10 of them in my department. I love living in Seattle. The weather is moderate, it rarely rains more than a drizzle, and there are distinct seasons. Plenty of sports and recreation options. Good education. Diverse population. Wonderful restaurants. Wide range of employment options. Good transportation systems. Strong healthcare systems. Down sides are: culture of friendly, but cold, cynical indifference (thus it is difficult to have deep relationships); no sense of community in order to get important projects approved and started in a timely manner; strong "me-first" attitude. For those just browsing this site, you may have been shocked to see such extremely negative views on Seattle. There seems to be a couple people that have flooded the internet trying to present the most biased and extreme view possible of Seattle. It should be obvious that these people have a very angry agenda and should NOT be taken seriously. I just want to let you all know these people do represent Seattle or its residents. I am not saying Seattle is perfect because there are many problems here like any city, but it is generally a great place to live. Seattle is fun recreation and shopping wise now as for the job market its hard even to find retail or fast food jobs . There isnt very many minorities very very caucasion and maybe a little asian thats about it . The whole time i was i sensed alot of racial tension from the minorities and whites . A apartment thats less than 500 sq ft its upwards of 700 dollars and up ! A nice place to visit but not live if you like diversity and job oppurtunities . Theres alot of gay people there and they seem as undiverse as everybody else there . Everybody looks the same ! People: Passive aggressive. Customer service is excellent compared to Chicago, and people you meet on the street are polite, but beyond surface interaction they have little to them. There has been an unfortunate influx of twenty-something hipsters in recent years, driven to this city no doubt because of tales of eco-friendly grocery stores and innumerable grunge bands. They are aloof, obnoxious know-it-alls with sticks up their asses. I find myself afraid to go into a number of coffee shops for fear that they will all laugh at me if I pronounce my order wrong. I find myself constantly reminding them that there is no better place to live in the States than Washington. Thanks to major companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Boeing, and Nordstrom, the economy in Seattle and surrounding cities continues to bustle, even in tough times. Even today, while we are entering a recession and housing markets suffer throughout the nation - in Washington, days on the market may be longer, but residentials and condos are still selling on an average of 60-80 days and we are only seeing significant price reductions in new construction homes. Crime and Police: There is a major lack of a police force. I think these guys are awesome, don't get me wrong, but when you can drive all around town and probably not even see a cruiser, there is something wrong with the numbers. It's a fairly safe city, for now, but over the last year I have noticed a growing number of incidents in my personal life (three family incidents) within less than a year: smash-and-grab, purse-snatching and attempted burglary. Hey Cannabis is legal, big deal. It would seem to indicate that violent crime may be on the rise, as is homelessness. I am from Pontiac, MI and Los Angeles, CA. I currently live in Vancouver,BC but toooooo expensive wife is canadian. I wanted to move to phoenix or sacremento. California is way too crazy meaning crime, finding housing, traffic and housing prices. I plan to move to seattle reason is good jobs, nice food,better place to start over. I hate rain but plan to retire in the desert tucson or las vegas for sure! People are very protective of seattle and a little off in the mind. Always be on your toes when you move make sure you talk to family and friends to see who has connections! The people in Seattle can be best described as self-absorbed narcissistic paradoxes. They are boorish, yet entitled; critical, yet defensive; friendly, yet superficial; nosey, yet introverted. These characteristics don't just affect socializing or making friends here, it's about daily interactions with people in traffic, at the store, at work. Seattleites' self-promoting, passive aggressive traits make it stifling and annoying to anyone not from the NW. Statistics on "transplants" aside, it's the local culture that pervades and you will be an interloper unless you assimilate. A walk around Greenlake will give any new comer, or someone thinking about moving to Seattle, a very good overview of who we are. People rush each morning to the nearest coffee house. Most of us are not rude. We all want one of our professional sports teams to be world champions. We want our childern to be safe, and develope socially, and academically. The air quality is argueably the best in the nation. We have a lot of trees, and greenery hence the O2 is good. We tend to drive too much, and someday our public transportation will give us the choice of getting off the highways. I happen to love the weather here... if I experience another 95 degree, high humidity day ever again it will be way too soon. The winters can be gray, granted, but the summers more than make up for them... plus, I (again, to each his own) would much rather be walking around a well-decorated and lit, thriving downtown retail core on a crisp winter night drinking coffee and window shopping as opposed to driving to a suburban mall in Texas wearing shorts and a t-shirt in mid-December. Seeing snow capped mountains and beautiful forests adds to the beauty of the region -- year-round. Seattle people are intelligent, but incredibly insular. They see themselves as knowledgeable, but they know little of people outside the Portland-Everett corridor (nor do they really care to know - the stereotypes are just fine with them). They are quick to judge and feel superior to others whose intellect, economics, or views are different from theirs, though they make absolutely no effort to understand others' sociology (thus, the "Wal-mart", "pickup trucks with W stickers" and other snicker-at-the-rednecks type comments in some of these postings by people who "love" the place). I moved to Seattle from Eugene,Oregon last year. The transition was smooth and I felt right at home here in West Seattle. Seattle is a beautiful and unique community. The puget sound and olympic mountains are majestic. On my morning walks I am able to enjoy the aesthetics all around me. However, Seattle is expensive and the job growth is rather bleak. There are more wealthy people per capita in Seattle than anywhere else in the country. 65% of the population do not have children. So if you have a family, Seattle may not be the place for your or your kids. This is a rich person's town. Hey "Native" Ever wonder how communities of Ethiopians, Somalians, Ukrainians, and other self confident individuals have thrived in Seattle? They don't need your "friendship" or the approval of the rest of the people who lived here before they got here. If you are neurotic and codependant, then yes, you will have a hard time making new friends and meeting people. I am going to say that it seems people from California and the south seem to be too high maintenance and self conscious to really fit in, if you need a lot of other people to validate your existence this isn't the place for you. On the upside are the mountains, the fact that it is a compact area and easy to get around, not overly crowded, ferry boats that take you to the surrounding islands, and just extremely unique. On the bad side are the people;(yes the Freeze is real), the cost of living, undersized, overpriced ugly houses and architecture, and just the negative vibe here, along with the weather. Prices are down 20% here, but it still isn't enough to tempt me. It feels cold to me all the time, but I'm a sun and warmth person.I think 60 and rainy is cold, not refreshing. I'm not of the "rain is magical" ilk. This place is bad. When I first got stationed here, we was warned having DOD stickers on our car could get our windows broken out. People attack the military. People attack anybody with any right wing opinion. This place has went so far left, you cannot hold a conversation with somebody for more then two minutes before they start trying to talk liberal vomit and complain about the President. If you're some brainwashed super anti America liberal, who hates anybody thinking differently then you do. Then this place is great. If you're any form of a normal human being, stay away from Seattle. First off, it may be a good idea to get a reality check about Seattle, and then of course, we'll get to the good stuff. I'm a Seattle native-and it is true, Seattlites are passive. I don't think I've ever had but one close friend ever. I can say after living in crappy-because-I-can't-find-a-job California after a few years it was a lot easier to make friends there. California IS friendlier, but we're debating the good and bad of Seattle here. In Seattle, people are nice in a friendly way, though not actually willing to make friends. Seattle is not the most sociable city (maybe the weather?). Am looking to move next year away from Chicago. Been here 12 years now, and very unhappy with Chicago, and Illinois. Many reasons for this. HOwerver, I am looking for some good information about moving to Seattle and quality of life. I am in Information Technology and am thinking I will be able to find work reasonably easily. Also have added massage therapy to my resume. I am an avid runner, scuba diver, and bicyclist. Would like to be able to pursue these activities year round and enjoy living in a city for a change. Is the cost of renting an apartment or town home in Seattle that expensive? Back to housing. Sure the median price is $420k. But that is the median for a home (not a house, so this includes studio condos) and the figure spans the entire county. Realistically, a two bedroom, one bathroom, 1,000 s/f fixer upper in a Seattle neighborhood that is 20 minutes + from downtown (let us not to forget to account for bad traffic!) costs between $400k - $500k. Many of these homes need a lot of work, too. They have single-paned windows (so all the heat escapes), plaster walls, and they lack grounded (three-prong) outlets. Comfort comes at a premium. So do backyards (no matter how small). . Apartments in bellevue ate rather dated and don't have much to offer unless you live near downtown Bellevue. Kirkland is upper middle class city nice parks. Close to the city Redmond where beautiful Marimoor Park is. No real entertainment. Great place to raise children. However very limited in cultural diversity unless Asian and White is diverse enough for you. Very fewlimited apartments. Several privatechurches schools near by. Issaquah is an upper middle class city. Houses start in the high $400,000 but due to the housing market housing cost have decreased and that statement applies to all of the cities But with all the pluses, don't be naive. If you think the rain and cloudiness are something you can quickly adapt to, chances are you will be in for a very unpleasant surprise. A grayness, with drizzle and rain, settles in relentlessly by mid-September, lifts for a couple weeks in April as a tease, and then returns well into June. Summers often are short. I witnessed three years in my 34 where summer sunshine lasted less than three weeks. When the rain returns in September, it WILL be gray and rainy for months. Also, while Seattle isn't a big snow city, the damp cold feels very cold and can last a long time. I've lived in Seattle my whole life but am coming to realization that I can no longer afford to live here. Housing costs keep going up, my wages staying the same, and I want to be able to buy a house someday to provide some security for my 3 kids, but the way the market's looking, that is NEVER going to happen. So in other words, seriously thinking about relocating, but where? Want to stay close to family here but other than that, I want to find a place w/ decent cost of living, good jobs, low crime, good school system, etc. If anyone could help me out w/ some suggestions, it would be much appreciated. Thank you! It's a very competitive place to live and work. I have worked as both a perm and contractor in many companies here, and I honestly have never seen so many people who pretend to be a friend and then stab you in the back while they position themselves to steal your job. This has happened to both me and my husband many times here--in different companies. (He and I work in different professions, and have both encountered this.) It's totally unreal. I never encountered this type of behavior in other states I've lived. I have witnessed this behavior the entire time I've lived in this city--both during good economies and bad. I would say that many people that I have met in Seattle are not socially aggressive; you have to say hi and initiate conversations not expect others to do so. I would say that the average Seattlite is well-read and conscientious though. I have seen random pedestrians picking up trash on the street here and not I'm talking about some organized clean-up. There's a charming spirit in Seattle: neighborhood businesses set out water bowls for pedestrians' dogs to lap from, there are street musicians and artists all over town, plenty of quirky coffee shops and bookstores, Pike Place market, lots of block parties in the summer months. The people that complain that Seattle sucks, I wonder if perhaps this would be their view no matter where they lived. Because life doesn't come on a silver platter - it's your personal creation for good or bad. The expectation of the quality of life improving is always why anyone leaves current friends and family behind, to venture to a new place. Seattle offers a lot and introspection is one attribute. Once I watched the sun rise while camped on a alpine mountain top, sipping tea, and observed the morning mist evaporating into the day. This is the day I came to love the Seattle area, and I can never think of any place better. But now, things have changed for the worse. I've never been an outdoors person, and so much of life around here is centered around that. I don't like dogs. The fall-winter-spring grayness depresses me. I'm a childless widow, no longer young (59), and retired. I do do some volunteer work, but still it is almost imposible for a single woman of my age to make new friends, especially if you're shy in social situations like I am. I'm not even looking for romance--just plain friends of either sex. The number I have now I could count on one hand. And I'm not dull--I'm a professional artist, Mensa member, healthy, have a youthful attitude, etc. There are pockets of cheap areas to live hidden away in unlikely areas. Seattle is divided into neighborhoods and real estate agents have learned what people will pay to live in an area called by a certain name. Don't be afraid of stigmas attached to the names of neighborhoods. For instance, until the 1980s, people considered a neighborhood called "Fremont" as a low income area because it had a high crime rate. However, artists moved into the low cost apartments, fixed up their homes and started businesses, and the area is now considered an eclectic and fun place to live. It is now one of the most expensive areas to live within the city. Social: Tents on the street. People will literally pass out on the sidewalk, usually on Heroin (which by the way you will see people shoot up on park benches, broad daylight and not in the 'bad' areas. The amount of homelessness is steadily growing day by day. In a city where people are living in $500,000 2 bedroom homes, there are people living just outside around the corner under a tarp. The most recent jerk-knee reaction from the mayor? Approve another tent city. In NY you can immediately get shelter and aid. Here, if you are homeless you are in danger. There's not enough people to care and the disjointed government agencies are laughable. It's possible to become the kind of person you want to be here, like having chickens in your yard in Ballard, listening to International lectures at Kane Hall at the UW, visiting 100 artists in one residence at Western Studios on First Thursdays, or just hanging out on the waterfront while pretending to be a tourist. Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to drink coffee. There are an incredible array of tea houses that cater to those who like to get out and not get buzzy. Yes, grunge was here, and mostly it's gone. House music is prevalent, but you can always go to Neighbors for the best sound system, and dance like a maniac until 4:00 am. First off, to the idiot who just vomited acidic vitriol all over this forum, gimme a damn break. I can see where you're coming from with regards to the rich, mindless yuppies who come from far and wide to drive up our housing costs and cause an already crowded metro area to become even more crowded. However, those aren't the only people who move to this area in search of a better life with better jobs in a very, very awesome section of the PNW. There are decent, respectful folks who aren't rich who chose to move to YOUR city of all places out of all others (should make you feel a bit special, right?) and who blend in very well with the local culture. Since being in the Seattle area for more than three years I find they have an "Northwest" attitude. Having grown up in Chicago area, living four years in the Bay Area of San Francisco, twenty-six years in Dallas/Ft. Worth, and two years in Nashville, plus traveling 2.8 million miles in business I would have to say Seattle is the worst when it comes to liberalism, stuck up, my S$#& don't stink attitude. UW is the worst for discrimination and cover up that I've ever seen. My wife who's a MD/PhD has experienced this first hand. If you're of a certain nationality you can do no wrong. But if your new to this country they treat you as a form of legalized slavery. I live in the Fremont area of Seattle (on Lake Union) and work downtown. It takes me 12 minutes from door to door to get to work... and my neighborhood is extremely walkable with tons of parks, restaurants, clubs, and great transit options. After looking at some of the more negative comments on this website, it appears to me that most of these people do not live within Seattle but live in a far-flung suburban communities. Traffic can be bad coming from these places (as it is just about everywhere in this country)... and I imagine it would be far more difficult to meet people out there. So, as a resident of Seattle, I, again, have to say that my experiences have been VERY positive. If you love the mountains, hiking..the water and THE RAIN.. Then you wanna live here. There is plenty to do if you are a "granola" and you don't mind ALWAYS being rained on.. YES, I SAID ALWAYS.. this is no joke.. it s the most annoying thing about living her.. You can't plan ANYTHING outside unless you are okay being rained on.. BBQs! NOPE.. summer is usually short lived here. I have lived her on and off for many years, I have left for many years, had to come back. I am planning my escape now.. waiting or my son to graduate highschool. This place can truly be depressing. It's like waking up with a blanket on our head and walking around. GREY< GREY< GREY! 50 shades of grey people! Seattle is one of the best big cities in the United States. The city has beautiful views of Mt. Rainier to the south and Mt. Baker to the north, and has good weather devoid of extremes. Seattle is also a nice place to raise a family, with low crime for a large city and an excellent public school system. On the downside, the very high cost of living and housing makes it inaccessible to most middle-class people. While it rarely snows in the city, rain is common and there is a general lack of sunny days compared to other cities in the United States. Also, if you don't like the typical disadvantages of living in a big city (such as crowding and traffic), Seattle is not the place for you. The whole area is beautiful, but you must be prepared for a couple of things. The joke is that Seattle is so tough, that even the sun doesn't come here. The second thing is a phenomenon called "Seattle Freeze." Go to You Tube to see some documentaries on it. The people here are polite but not very friendly. "Let's get together sometime," really means "get away from me." You must be prepared to have NO friends here for a loooooong time, unless you already know people out here already before you move here. I cannot emphasize this enough. The weather is gloomy, the people pretentious and gloomier, and you will need to deal with the isolation and gloominess yourself. If you can handle both, then you will be okay. I was born and raised in Seattle and despite having lived in other areas of the country I always seem to return home. I have noticed a drastic change in this city over the last decade. There is a general malaise concerning the citizenry here.A brand of "Conservative liberalism" runs rampant here, meaning the people (who are generally not from here) are very self-absorbed, neurotic, closeted, and self-repressed. The majority are aspiring yuppies to be. Seattle also is an extremely gentrified city. The rent/cost of living is outrageous if you wish to live within the city limits, due to the fact it caters to the tech industry. Even with a BA it is difficult to find a job here that pays little more than minimum wage. One downfall about the demographics here is that I don't really think Seattle is a great place to be black. Most of the non-whites (Asian, mostly) live in the suburbs, not in the city of Seattle. Regardless of how "liberal" a reputation Seattle has, I get the impression a lot of people here just aren't accustomed to black people and aren't comfortable around blacks. I am not black myself, but the black people I've interacted with here don't seem very happy and have a chip on their shoulder about being black here (I don't blame them, I would too). I would not want to raise a black child here, out of fear that they would have identity problems because they stick out like a sore thumb. But that's just my perspective. I've lived in Seattle 8 years and, despite my passion for the outdoors, consider it a huge mistake to have moved here. (I'm stuck for now.) The gorgeous scenery is almost 'mocking' in its contrast to the true ugliness of the people (with precious few exceptions). They are cold, pretentious control freaks who cannot tolerate differences of opinion on even the most mundane matters(despite their desperate calls for 'diversity'... yet the majority of the population is economically well-off & white--go figure). Add to this, commuting is LA-awful, cost of living is excessively high, and the job market isn't worth delving into unless you're a techy. What's really enigmatic is their constant bragging about what a 'World Class City' this is. The very best things are there are beautiful mountains, the Puget Sound and all sorts of stuff within your fingertips. The downside to this is for instance, having to book a place to camp in January for the upcoming season. You will see people on your treks unless you go far out, like the backside of Mt.Olympus or the Wonderland trail. The mountains here are stunning. The weather is very mild, coming from central PA, I would say we had just about as many overcast drizzly days there, near close to it. You get used to the rain and just go out in it. Oysters here are the best I have had from all over the US, the Dungeness is not to be missed, and the King Salmon rocks, if you can afford about $25/lb. For the good stuff, that's about it. DONT COME HERE. You will not be able to find an apartment and you will be homeless. Minimum wage is $15 but you will live on the street. There is rental discrimination here, landlords only want to rent to tenants who are single and work for Google or Facebook. The job market is overflowing but the housing crisis is detrimental. City officials have taken care of the issue by creating tent encampments. So they basically don't care. The middle and lower class of become completely displaced by the over-gentrification of the city. Do not move to Seattle expecting to LIVE in Seattle. You will most likely be living in Auburn, Renton, or Tacoma, there you can have a decent living situation, just have a car. Average commute times are atleast an hour. Is it gray outside for many months of the year, well of course it is! Is it harder to meet people here than lets say the south; you bet it is but when you do make friends, you make them for life! Are the schools surprisingly spotty...well yes and no depending on where you are. Do I know every nook and cranny, every school, basically the best of the best about what makes Seattle a wonderful place to live...I try to and I make it my business to do just that, all while doing it from the perspective of someone who the city really had to grow on to the point where I now don't know if I could live anywhere else in the United States. Surprising? Well it surprised me that's for sure! I would love to answer any and all of your questions so bring them on! Native born Seattleite (24 years) who wishes he never would have left. I have read all the opinions of Seattle both good and bad but for Seattle is always will be home. Like alot other people I left in pursuit of affordable housing which in my mind equaled a better quality of life boy I was wrong. I have lived in other places and frankly, none of them compare to the Seattle area in culture, people, and scenery. I currently live in Phoenix and I hate it!!! no culture its hell hot six months out of the year, the people aren't progressive or logical in their thinking, and its brown and flat. I do however own property in Phoenix and in a year or so am looking to sell it and purchase property in the Seattle area. Then I can go home whenever I want!!! Cons- rent and real estate are way over priced. Must have a good paying job to have a decent lifestyle here. People are strange, passive-aggressive, distant, and pretentious. Making new friends is difficult. More transplants than natives. If I were to speak with 10 people today, at least 8 of them would be from another state. Advanced technology here, seems to equate to very poor human interaction/communication. People here do not communicate well, if at all. Everyone is married to their cell phone and laptop. Homelessness - beggars everywhere you go. They setup outside of banks, grocery stores, theatres, restaurants, on city blocks, etc. There is not a day that I walk down the street without being approached for money. This happens in all parts of town. I have been all over the United States &have never experienced a city or area as hateful and unaccomodating to masculine things as I have in the Seattle area. Even though this would never be admitted, because it isn't politically correct, women rule there. The culture is backwards almost when it comes to male-female relationships. Generally speaking, the men act very feminized and the women very masculine-(masculine in that they are terminally dominant and act like an alpha male dog). Men: if you have even a pair of testicles left, you will not move there. And if you live there already, leave. These people, namely the female gender, like I said, are TERMINAL. They won't change. It is that bad. It so deeply imbedded in them that no 'anti-feminism' will stop it. Like most of the W coast, this is a big-time liberal mecca. If you are a conservative, you need to heed this advice and re-think your decision to move here. We have lived in several different areas of the country. We had no idea how unpleasant it would be living here because of the politics. You don’t dare put any kind of conservative sticker on your car. We tried that when we first moved here—the sticker was ripped off our car, torn into little pieces, and thrown on top of our trunk. So much for free speech. You’d better not even open your mouth about your conservative views here. We were harassed and continue to be in our workplaces as others learn we are not liberals. We do not even engage with others in talking about the subject, but somehow they find out. It isn't a very religious city, which I also enjoyed; no one I ever dated or befriended tried to convert me. But in a similar complaint regarding straight 20-35 yr old culture, there is a common immaturity where people try to have their cake and eat it too. I've met a few people who bemoan the difficulty meeting someone fairly wholesome who doesn't take shots every night, but after getting better acquainted, they'll reveal that they're polyamorous or into hard drugs, etc. I think it's completely understandable to either sow wild oats or to settle down, but I think there is a tendency for this age group to feel entitled to have both, despite the contradiction. I didn't really take many humanities classes in college, but the phrase "prolonged adolescence" comes to mind. Back to the city... I love the nature and the beauty of Seattle. You feel this large forest is surrounding a big city, so it gives you a vibe that is unlike any other major city in the country. The skyline on a clear day with the water, the mountains, the skyscrapers and the Space Needle... one of the most underrated in the country. It's so clean and fresh everywhere. Seattle has a lot of very cool neighborhoods with unique coffee shops, concert venues or other entertainment spots. I think to really experience Seattle you have to experience the neighborhoods. Sure, EMP, the Space Needle, Pikes Market, etc. are all fun tourist spots, but they aren't the "real" Seattle. You have to dig deeper to find it, and what you'll find will be what's really special about this city. As a recent transplant from Mobile, Alabama , I have experienced many of the backwards ways expressed by the majority on this site. Yes, Seattle is a beautiful place. It has mountains, vast forests, and is in close proximity to Canada. On the other hand, I have not been accepted as well as I would have thought. I am often ridiculed for my "southern accent". I have been told things such as "You're from Alabama? You don't sound that dumb!". I don't expect to be lovingly embraced or anything, but a little bit of common courtesy might be nice. The job market is good here, hence the constant flow of newbies like me to the area. Traffic is crazy and everyone drives below the speed limit. Seattle has it's advantages, but look way in before moving here. You may just be disappointed. I went on a road trip a few years ago to pick up a classic car that I had always dreamed of owning. I bought it off of ebay from a man in Arizona and planned a trip from Arizona to Las Vegas to California and back home to Washington in the month of August. After 10 days of unbearable heat driving through Arizona (where I visited my brother there who had foil covering his windows to keep the heat at bay!), Las Vegas (where my car almost overheated going from the Venetian to the Luxor), California (where you can't separate clouds from smog) - it was truly an awe-inspiring sight when we finally re-entered Washington State. The streets are wide, there is green as far as the eye can see, the air is crisp and fresh, the sky is pure blue... I fell in love all over again with my hometown. you expect a fast pace of life....the pace here is slower than rest of the country. I've seen transplants move here and complain that WA drivers are too slow or that Seattleites are reserved. Our roots come from Nordic countries, therefore, we can be reserved but friendly. I can easily pick out a transplant driver on the roads...they are usually impatient and aggressive, cutting in and out of traffic and not using their turn signal. If you can NOT adapt to slower pace here then don't bother moving here. Cops love to catch transplant drivers. I've seen Seattle change for the worse because of some drivers refusing to accept that it is slower here. Also, I know many people who moved here and were unhappy because they couldn't make enough friends so they left. It takes a few years to develop solid friendship here. Do you want the Truth or do you just want to hear what you want to hear? Saying something 'good' even though it's not True is a wasteful.If Seattle happens to be a crappy town, then so be it. Then it can change, when people finally stop being in denial about it and being so defensive. Ya know, that could be why it remains to be a crappy town, 'cause nobody wants to open up and let thier city be 'operated on'. So the cancer gets worse. And denying that a semi truck is headed your way, isn't going to make it go away. This is something dumb Seattlites can't seem to understand. Intellectual, yes. INTELLIGENT? No. There's a world of differnce you Seattelites with the lites out. (and yes I am aware that is not the correct spelling for 'lights' so don't analize that and miss the big point hear. That just shows what I'm talking about.) I have not had one problem meeting people here -- and I knew no one when I came. My attitude is what you put out there is what you get back in return... and it has served me well. There are few natives to Seattle (which is why I kind of resent some of the blanket statements about "Seattle people" I've read here) -- but most of my friends are very happy here and delight in getting together on a regular basis. I have a much better social network here, after two years, than I did in any of the other cities I've lived in. I've gotten involved in many social groups and have really enjoyed how open and non-judgmental people are here. Are there liberals here? - you betcha... but I've also found it balanced and tolerant politically. Everyone has a voice... and people can agree to disagree. Overall, I've found people here quite nice and respectful. I read all of the reviews here. Everyone is right to some degree. Times are changing and things are getting more expensive. I am moving from Chicago to Seattle. I previously lived in Denver. My parents live in Portland so I am trying to move a bit closer. After all of the complaints that I have heard about Seattle, come live in Chicago, NYC or LA for a little while and you will feel much better. I personally think Chicago is a pit! It is great for food, drink, and the boating on the lake but everything else is sub par in my opinion. Things are ridiculously expensive here, people are rude, congestion is terrible, and mass transit, although good, is disgusting dirty and crowded. I think that if you don't like where you live - move. Seattle has a lot of promising things to offer as well as its downfalls. Make the best of it, strive for a better job, or move!!! There is more than meets the eye when it comes to Seattle. Visitors will no doubt be charmed by the mountain and Puget sound views. But after living here certain things begin to wear on you. Traffic. Mind-numbing excessive traffic. The weather and what feels like never ending gray overcast days at times. And when it rains, it likes to do so all day long. But the most prevalent problem is the overcrowding, and this keeps property prices very high. Also because of the economy, many employers are freezing wages, and wages in general just aren't enough to cover what is asked for houses around here, therefore there is a very large contingent of people who rent. Seattle natives are passive-aggressive, which isn't a flaw I'm just telling it like it is. Also if you come from an area where you say hi to people when you walk by them, that dies when you get to Seattle. I have lived in Seattle for 36 years. It has changed a lot - for better and worse but is still lovely. Still a place at 23 I would want to move to - even more than the city it was in 1980. I can't imagine finding a city with more resources at your fingertips, more caring about the environment, more beautiful, or a better place to garden. But I do know of places much more affordable - especially now (2016) and much easier to live on a fixed or lower income. That is why I am retiring elsewhere with great sadness but also knowing that I will never have to sit through three months of solid rain again. Days of precipitation surprisingly on 17 more than middle TN (can that be right?) but days of gray 65 more. I'll take the sunshine and the hard rain then sun and the much much lower cost of living. Great place to live with a good job. I love you Seattle, always will. I have to agree with those commenting on the sorry state of life in Seattle and Puget Sound. I've lived here since 1978 and have seen Seattle slowly go downhill from a clean, uncrowded, upbeat and friendly town to a dirty, sprawling megalopolis of self-absorbed rich thirty-somethings who think they own the world. Unfortunately, in Seattle they do. So, if you drive a Lexus SUV with an empty Thule roof-rocket, drink ten dollar lattes, think nothing about ten and fifteen mile long traffic backups (why care? you can yammer away on your bluetooth and watch a DVD!), and feel you're exempted from the "little-people" laws like stopping for red lights, then Seattle is just the place for you. I used to have a license plate holder that read "Welcome to Washington - Now go home." Now that I'm finally getting out of here it reads "Welcome to Washington - You can #!@*$% have it!" I have lived in several other cities, and have traveled quite a bit as well too, so I think what I am saying is true. It's funny, people in Seattle drive freaking slow. I have never driven in a city where people actually drive SLOWER than the speed limit on the freeway, and for NO REASON! It's like they took a bunch of sleeping pills washed down by some warm milk then decided to jump into their Subaru Outbacks and head to Whole Foods or Trader Joe's to buy some organic something or other. Also, I have read a lot about how people here are not as friendly, are kind of stand-off-ish, and I thought that would not apply to me, I am rather friendly and outgoing. I take my dog to the dog park daily, always try to be friendly, it's amazing how many people will talk to my dog (who doesn't TALK BY THE WAY) but will completely ignore my presence. What is wrong with people around here. I was born in Seattle and my family have lived here since the 40's. I moved to CA when I was in grade school as my dad was in the navy. I came back to Seattle with my family in 1995. The climate here has always been beautiful summers and overcast drizzly winters but when working your pretty much inside anyway. Overall Northwesterners themselves are pretty friendly. Whats changed was when the tech bubble was strong a lot of people bought propert here on spec and priced homes out of reach for the average person. A lot of techies also moved here for microsoft and that changed the personality of the area. Overall if you like to camp, hike, ride bikes or be around the water its a great place. You can be from the city to the mountains in 45 minutes.Over all air quality is excellent. Rain over the past 5 years has been different a lot at once I would guess because of global warming I have lived all over Washington state. I have visited just about EVERY town, city, and junction in it as well. I have my favorites- Spokane being my favorite city. And I have my dislikes- I dont like Tacoma. I find Seattle is in the middle. I traveling through there, but as a true Washingtonian, you have to sometimes. Traffic stinks. But I hear it isn't as bad as some places. The people there aren't always the friendliest. But you manage. I could go on and on about the dislikes and the problems Seattle has. But I wont. I will say, that they have some of the best day adventures! Where else can you go see the Pacific Science Center? I have been there twice, and it just keeps getting neater! Where else has some of the best coffee shops on every block? Hate it or love it- Starbucks is there- on every block!! You have the EMP, Pike Place market, Seattle Aquarium, and so much more. I've never encountered so many people who were so sure they were right and who were so averse to self-evaluation. I came in to lead a failing non-profit that wanted to turn things around “at all costs” and was certain I was the only guy who could do the job. It defined itself in terms of concern, sacrifice, vision, change, compassion, and honesty. Even in this environment the actual traits were "don't make me feel guilty", "don't make me feel obligated”, "don't ask us to change our routines", “don't get to know me beneath the surface", "don't expect me to care about anyone beneath the surface", "people are objects", "don't expect me to have a conversation with you if I'm unhappy about something". Yet, "I want you to tell me I'm doing good things and that I'm a good person". Seattle hates to be challenged, corrected, or made to feel bad about itself. But when it is, it won't talk about it. I relocated here from the Detroit area seven months ago. To be honest, I am already looking at other places to move to. Unless you have a lot of money, this is not a good place to live. Don't get me wrong, the city is beautiful and I am most impressed at the intercity parks. There is also a lot of culture here and nightlife. But you gotta have wads of cash or forget it. I relocated my business here thinking that it would thrive and be more affordable. There is no state income tax but everything costs so much more. People do not seem to want to pay much for consulting, computer training, and tax preparation. Not anymore than Michiganians would pay, but the costs are sky high. I am paying $425 per month for a 12X12 room in shared housing. I have to share a kitchen, and bathroom with many other people. Seattle is not worth this type of compromise. I look forward to leaving within the next year. NATIVE is not telling the whole story. We moved to Seattle from the Midwest and found Seattle to be much friendlier than our previous town. Seattleites are very polite (possibly to a fault) and engaging. Yes, the much-reported passive aggressiveness is present, but only in the same proportion, and in place of, the bigotry, racism, and xenophobia found elsewhere. If you expect to find immediate friendship in the local Starbucks you might be disappointed. But if you become involved in your local school, church, library association, volunteer group, youth sports organizations, or other positive social circle, you will be welcomed and befriended freely and warmly. Outdoor volunteer groups are especially welcoming and offer the reward of regular activities in the spectacular natural settings around Seattle. But you must leave your provincial attitudes and prejudices behind if you wish to blend in. Recently moved to Seattle from Memphis. It is beautiful here (at least one day a week when you can see the mountains), but I cannot stand the constancy of the blah grey skies. Especially when you're used to the sun from time to time. And the people! Quite depressing. I'd say 95% of the people I've encountered here look at me like I am from the moon when they hear my southern accent. Apparently everyone has seen too many cliche movies of southern rednecks, therefore I certainly MUST be an idiot, and probably live in a trailer, too. After I receive stares from people who look at me like I am in the zoo, some venture out of their cool shell exteriors enough to inquire about the origin of the southern twang. "Memphis? Wow, the east coast!" (!!!???) OR "Isn't it really hot down there?" with looks of horror on their faces. TRUST ME Southerners -- Think long & hard before you move up here. Then think again! Seattle is a great place to live. But you can't look at Seattle alone for the reason why. Within just a few hours from Seattel there is rainforsts, deserts, mountains, oceanside, plains....anything you can imagine Seattle has it closeby. This is so nice all year long because there is really no reason to ever be bored. There are cultural spots- the Seattle Symphony, 5th Ave and Seattle Rep Theaters, Seattle Art Museum- just to name a few. You also have the Museum of Flight, the Underground Tour, the Seattle Aquarium, the Pacific Science Center, the Woodland Park Zoo (with a GORGEOUS rose garden)- for educational and fun outings. You ahve multiple spots int he Puget Sound for Great skiing, boarding, hiking, camping, boating, fishing, horseback riding, kayating, sailing, etc....you name it and the Puget Sound has it! On top of that there are lots of club- more opening up regularly, and even better bars and pubs! There are lots of theories about this place. One is that there is this weird chemistry between long-termers who, deep down, are small-town/small city people who feel obligated to be more cosmopolitan than they really are (and resent it), coupled with tons of people who are escaping from somewhere else. These latter are often trying to shake off what they believe to be their oppressive and small-minded families, towns and cities, or businesses so they can finally be free to accomplish all they've dreamed. They are often fundamentally angry people, people desperate to prove their individual worth, or arrogant people who believe little people have held them back - and now they get to be big people in a cool city. But they are actually self-absorbed people who don't realize they are moving to a city of self-absorbed people, who are leaving one set of supposedly oppressive rules for another set of oppressive rules. Seattleites have been accused of being self-centered snobs “Seattle Freeze”, we have bad traffic most major cities do, and the myths and misconceptions of rain, and the high cost of living which is due to people wanting to live here from across the country yeah Topeka Kansas is cheap but who wants to live there?. Here is what people don’t get or don’t care to get about Seattle and the Pacific Northwest in general. According to the 2000 census 2/3rds of all people living in the Seattle area were born in another state truly making Seattle a transplant city. Reasons for this explosion in people was due to Seattle’s transformation from a city based on Aerospace (Boeing) and Timber economy to a computer/IT economy, the demise of the quality of life for middle class Californians especially Southern Californians looking for a cheaper way of life, and for years publications praised Seattle for being the most livable city. There's no racism in Seattle. The black community tends to live in SE Seattle, but there's no problem if black people live elsewhere. Seattle is a liberal city, and almost everyone here is a Democrat. If you lived in Dixie and loved it, don't move to Seattle. Seattle is as different from Dixie as you can get. The weather is cool and grey most of the year. Drizzling is commoner than heavy rain. Snow is rare, and it doesn't last long if it does snow. People are very polite, but Seattleites are not very outgoing. If you are a black person in a white neighborhood, and people seem polite but reserved, it's not a racial thing. That's how people treat each other in Seattle, no matter what their race. If you are careful to recycle, your neighbors will approve of you. If you want to talk about Jesus, or praise the 'job creators,' you will find that your audience has drifted away rather quickly, but politely, very politely. I live in the northeast. My husband and I are trying to relocate to Seattle. We find it very difficult getting any employers to look at us because we are out of state. People say move first and then apply for jobs. Given the way the economy is right now, I don't find that to be a wise decision. However, I really want to move out there. My husband graduated college with a BA in Computer Science back in 2013. I only have an associates degree and have been working in accounting for quite a few years now. Is it hard to get a job once you move there? In addition, do you find the people to really be distant? I hear about the Seattle Freeze a lot but don't know how true that is. Every place has pros and cons. Just curious if Seattle is really that bad. I've been out there lots of times. I am familiar with the rainy overcast weather. Of course visiting is way different then living there. Any advice will be greatly appreciated! What don't I like about Seattle? As a 20-something single, I don't feel like this is the most exciting place to be. Don't get me wrong, Seattle is beautiful. The greenery, the clean air, the mountains, the water, it's all here. But socially, this city seems to appeal more to wealthy folks over the age of 40 whose priorities are talking walks and having a garden in their backyard. The nightlife is not great, and you can go for miles and miles without seeing somebody in their 20's in many neighborhoods here. Not many families either, as they can't afford to live in the city. I really don't feel like there is enough noticeable population of singles in their 20s, outside of the University of Washington territory. Seattle is just not a city where people come to socialize and prioritize making new connections. They come here to enjoy the outdoors and live healthy. This could be a good or bad thing, depending on what you're into. I moved to Seattle from Denver about three years ago. Weighing both the positives and the negatives, I really like it here, even though I might move down to Southern California for more sunshine. I'm shocked at some of the very negative reviews that Seattle is getting, such as how the people are rude. I understand there are some cold people around here, but I've met plenty of nice, normal people that I go out with for beers on the weekend or hang out with. I think sometimes when it comes to making friends you have to make an effort, step out of your comfort zone or look in the mirror and maybe change your outlook. When I first moved here I didn't know anyone and it was lonely, not going to lie, but then I decided to go out to different things, get involved with certain clubs, and I met friends that I still hang out with to this day. Sure I've met some jerks or arrogant snobs, but you will meet those in any city you're in, trust me. I've lived here too long! Have stayed because of mother and relatives. But let me get to the point. If you want a job here in Seattle you had better be ready to compete for that retail clerk job with a hundred others that have a BA in something or another. There are more people with BA's here than anywhere else except San Francisco. You know what S.F. like? It's Seattle in 5 years. Great if your a yuppie and make 70K a year. Listen I know what I'm saying. I lived here on and off for 30 years. This place has gotten way too expensive ratio of wages to cost of living. Don't believe me check it out! Also the thing they say about people here and their friendliness its oh so true! I'll be freindly but I really don't want to be your freind. Its also true about diversity. It's here. But than again it's the norm not the exception. A lot of smugness. One more thing. When you move here from a semi sunny enviroment remember that around December to April you better hide those razor blades. It is a very cynical town and despite always talking about change, no one ever steps up to lead and really change anything. There seems to be a dark cloud over people, just like the sky most of the time. Plenty of people wear t-shirts and hold a sign but very few actually give time or money to the causes they seem to care about. People pride themselves here on being open, but really they are just as bad as the close minded people on the other end of the spectrum. There is an arrogance here underlying everything that seems to say "don't confuse me with the facts". Having a tattoo and dying your hair, deciding not to shave or have a job doesn't make one particularly unique or special, it just makes a person like everyone else who thinks they are being a rebel. They do not value community, family, history, or tradition. The people are very progressive in some ways, but not creative. Government here gets in the way of everything, and is woefully inept. Millions get spent on studies with no results. Seattle is suppose to be green? I don't think so, woods stoves pollute the air, old cars, terrible air pollution especially in the winter. If, you a runner forget it. Many of the people I observe here have insalubrious habits.....sleeping and eating after their dogs, sleazy hotel and motels. Lots of hookers though if you are into that. I've lives all over the country and Seattle takes the cake...especially on Aurora Ave from 135th to 80th Ave Colds and Flu abounds.......lots of sickly people.......too much of a liberal city. Very expensive here, it is beating out California now. Crime rates sky high, taxes galore, tolls on all bridges...like 6 and 7 dollars per trip. Gay Mayors.......quite racist as well here too! I was shocked for a liberal cities....I have found that conservative places are way less racist then liberal cities. And, in reality Liberals are into money and Conservatives are into sex! And, what's with the old-fashion wood stoves, I mean it's not like we are troglodytes. Use oil or electric for God's sakes. My wife needs a milder climate due to a medical condition. After having researched Portland well, I am looking at Seattle also! By the demographics, these seem to be our placees to consider. I was looking at Vermont originally. We don't want all the third world around us. Don't these people know they offend us when they dress in that attire. I don't wear swastikas, or dress like the Blues Bros. with a beard. The women can lighten up a bit and dress like the Indian women, not like for death in the desert.(black) Most of the men look like Hamas, not all. We want a better world for our daughter, with outdoors and the city ammenities. Chicago does not have desireable recreation!Too many cars and people! One has to drive so far. My wife is educ.from Moscow Univ.. It is too much to contemplate a move there. We would like to be around the Russian area. I understand Seattle and Portland have Russian! We watch figure skating, not world wrestling, or Howard Stern. Any advise on pros and cons? I've seen Sperling's Best Places. Thanks Seattle housing is expensive to BUY, but rents for apartments are not too bad. You can still find something fairly nice for 700 and up..maybe less. In summer it's wonderful, sunny and not too hot. You can swim in the lake right in the city on beaches for free! But from about Nov. to March it's pretty bleak and grey: not so wet, just grey, cloudy, bleak. Culturally it's great. Lots to do..But aside from really popular musical bands, local musicians DO NOT make money that much because club owners just talk about music but don't actually figure out to pay them. JOBS: salaries are not that high for the cost of living. Example: maybe a job will pay 3k a year higher, but won't make up for difference in cost. We have sales tax too, no state tax. Big benefit is living close to Canada. Fun to drive up to Richmond BC and Vancouver. Decent bus transportation. People generally polite but they don't have that "warmth" one feels in a diner in the East coast or in NYC (yes, NYC, even grouchy people are WARM in NYC and I'm not from there). I'm single (widowed) 48 years old and enjoy running, cycling and swimming. I compete in Ironman, marathons and triathlons. I've lived in Minnesota all my life but the winters are just getting worse and we're locked up for nearly 6-7 months with snow and freezing temps. I often hear that Seattle does have rain during the winter months, if I can put up with snow and freezing temps below 0 - I think I can handle rain. I want to be able to enjoy the change of seasons but not have the harshness of winter that I've known for so long. I work for a large financial institution, so finding a condo close to the downtown area so I can commute by walking or mass transit is prime. I want to be close to the opportunity to run and cycle without having to drive my car to get there and then run or ride. I hear Belltown is the place to live but certainly there must be communities around Belltown that can offer me just as good of a place to live. And I know that I don't have to worry about finding a Starbucks - they're everywhere and that's just awesome! The City Growth: This is a city that has neither planned nor cares to plan for the massive influx of people that were drawn here by the growing tech sector, excellent unemployment rate and potential. As a result, you have ridiculous rents and home prices that are soaring skyward. While these are nowhere near much of LA, San Francisco, NYC or DC, they are getting there fast. And the amount of inherent wealth is stunning. Their most major projects, the new 405 bridge and the marathon of the Bertha tunnel project are laughable. These don't solve much of anything, and while they are welcome improvements, they do nothing to solve the worsening traffic, which is only getting worse because the city is becoming so expensive and competitive, forcing people to the outskirts, which are also growing in cost. For the most part, renting a place here is like you take what is given to you because there are like 7 other capable tenants in line. If your credit is less than stellar, or you have ever had any trouble with past rentals, as they say in Joisey "Fuggedabouddit". People who review Seattle are seeming to come from one of two camps the disgruntled old timer who wishes things who can't deal with change either good or bad you know the conservative Bush lover who can't wait to go live in a conservative suburban sprawl cities like Phoenix or Vegas and the young liberal type who love the greenery, mountains/overall outdoors, and culture of urban Seattle. Its funny because the "conservative" gives their age and political views away with comments like hippies, socialist, and I have have lived here for 40 years. Honestly, I'm glad these people are leaving or want to leave. There is a reason why cities like Seattle, San Fran, Boston, your coastal cities on both the West and East coasts are leading "brain-gain" cities because we bring in fresh young LIBERAL college educated talent, go check the US census bureau, while places like the south, plains, states, and most of the upper midwest with the exception of the twin cities and Chicago fall behind in the "new technology". So hey I for one am glad conservatives are leaving the state good riddance!!! My partner and I recently moved to Boston and quickly we realized this was not the place for us. We are looking to relocate to Seattle, but we of course have some concerns. We are a lesbian couple, so first and foremost, would we be accepted? In Boston you would assume acceptance would be overflowing, but compared to our original city of akron ohio, it couldn't be more shockingly opposite. Also we are very social people that like the company of intelligent, artistic, and open-minded people. Along with that, it is fairly expensive to go out for a night in Boston. For example martini's are $11, a regular cocktail is $9, and a beer is $5.25 for domestic. We are wondering if these prices are similar to those in Seattle, but hopefully less? Other costs of living must be taken into consideration. Here, our 800sq ft apt, 13 miles outside of Boston is $1200/month, and it's mediocre to say the least. Basically, from this we are hoping to understand the little details of living in Seattle that no one ever knows until they are stuck into a situation. I would appreciate your feed back. Thanks No place is perfect is probably the best assessment for ANY cities anywhere in the world. Weather, cost of living, crime ,etc are just some of the variables to take into account. Additionally, everyone is looking for something different depending on their age, marital status, occupation, etc. I am here in the US for 26 years and had the opportunity to live in NYC, Atlanta and Seattle for the last 9 years and learned to appreciate Seattle's mild weather (no snow, no extreme heat or cold, mild rain) and the fact that my work place is a 10 minute walk from my residence. The more challenging side for me, is 1) the "inflatted" real estate market which is unreasonably high for living quarter that are the size of jewel box. The average Belltown condo price(one bedroom)is around $380 K for a 600 square feet 2)the lack of civility (often played down by saying that the locals are reserved and from Nordic descent...3) the lack of true cafe where people talked and engaged versus typing their life away on their laptop. That said, at the end of the day only you can decide if Seattle is or not for you. During that time, I've known probably ten families with children and assets who have read all the stories about how 'livable' Seattle is, seen the pretty pictures (which are taken during the four occasionally-sunny months of the year) and have moved here from their sunny homes in Arizona, New Mexico, Georgia, etc. , bought a home and have lasted about four years before they moved back to where they came from. They all made the mistake of thinking they could adapt to the climate here. Some people can, MANY can't. You see, the issue is not in the statistics of inches of rainfall per year. On that, Seattle is actually not very impressive at all. The rain here doesn't come in a torrential deluge, it comes in an irritating cold drizzle over the course of months, accompanied by depressing gray skies....and the gray skies are here most of the year, even when it's not raining. So, people frequently become afflicted with Seasonal Affective Disorder, also known as S.A.D. Syndrome, which is basically an emotional depression brought about by insufficient sunlight. There are therapies for it, but most afflicted people just eventually leave. I've lived in several areas around Seattle for the last ten years and I'm ambivalent about Seattle. The rainy, gray weather is about to drive me insane, every winter I get severely depressed -- and put on weight from lack of outdoor activities. On one hand, I love something about the Seattle people, they are highly intelligent and easy-going compared to the East Coast. The summers here are wonderful, very beautiful and full of activities. There are many intellectual and artistic activities, lots to do with the kids. The air is always fresh, the traffic easy, nothing is really crowded, and the cost of living not great, but not terrible. It's a pretty town, very quaint. On the other hand, I haven't made a single real friend in ten years, I'm unemployed -- yet again even though I have really good tech skills, my boyfriends lack a certain ambition and drive -- very sweet but-- boring? I crave a real man, someone who doesn't wear a baseball cap and dress like a ten year old. The winters are too long and dreary. Every year I plan on leaving and get beguiled by the summers into thinking this place isn't so bad. This year I'm going to leave... really. I have live here for over 30. I moved here a young man. I noticed that a lot of people on this site complain about the weather and the people. This bothers me. The people that are from here or have been here a long time are the nicest people I have meet. It's because it is a such a beautiful place that jerks have moved here and messed it up. Like all great cities. I see some people complaining that people are too smart for their own good here. Perhaps those people should just move back to their hick towns and get on with life? Seattle is a great town compared to other fantastic cities that everyone wants to move to. Sure the weather is wet, but didn't you know that before you moved here? It's not like we pretend it's dry here just to get you here so you can complain. Have you seen the skin of a 70 year old here compared to one in Palm Springs? The sun ages you. Have you ever thought that perhaps it's hard for you to make friends here because all you do is complain about the weather and the people. Life is what you make of it where ever you go. You decide everyday you get up if you are going to smile or frown. What are you going to decide today? Pros: Your starter house may have to be a condo instead of a house, but there are still places to buy for less than 200K. Real estate values in the area are steadily appreciating. If you’re willing to live in some of the outlying areas possibly south of Seattle you can still find something and later upgrade to closer in or bigger just depending on your values. Property taxes as a percentage of the home values are much lower than where we are currently living in the South. Seattle City Light is a municipal utility so your power bills are very inexpensive compared to power companies in other parts of the country. Also there is zero state income tax in WA state. The bus system Metro transit has reasonable fares and you can go anywhere you need to go in town so you don’t have to drive everywhere. Also the town is very walkable and bikeable. Some of my co-workers biked to work. Socially I had great friendships with people there that I saw on a day to day basis usually through work or church. I met my husband at church and he was a CA transplant. People that live in Seattle are pretty committed to sticking around so it’s not transient. It's clean it's pretty and it's arty. I spent five unhappy years in Seattle, going to college. It is true what people say about the place being unfriendly. If you say something to someone at a bus stop, say, or in a grocery store line, you receive an incredulous stare like you are crazy. The people are narrow-minded, arrogant and pretentious. They ridiculed me, a Southern boy, for how blacks were treated down South. I noticed blacks in Seattle were bottled up in a few parts of town, and not real welcome elsewhere around town. Only “white” blacks are welcome about town, and never in large numbers. The place is bleeding heart liberal country with all its folly. Once I complimented a woman on her looks. Another woman accused me of sexual harassment. Political correctness rules, meaning everyone is afraid to do anything because someone will be offended. When white officers were acquitted in the Rodney King trial, robotic students attacked the admin building at the UW, mindlessly running liberal programming code. If you don’t agree with the obnoxious liberal politics, you are singled out to be persecuted. If you are poor, God help you. This is a city in love with money, appearances and pretension. Yes, it’s very pretty despite all the ugliness. Avoid. . . . Also, Seattle has so much to see and do. Seattle has a truly impressive and beautiful downtown. Seattle has a huge skyline…unlike Portland. I feel like I’m actually in a major city in Seattle. Another thing I'm not used to being from Portland. Seattle is a major city. You feel like you are in a vibrant and alive city. From my Portland experience, I felt like I was in a much smaller town there. Seattle has great shopping, great restaurants. The Pike Place Market is amazing and a one-of-a-kind place in the USA. Seattle has salt water (Puget Sound) on the west side of it and fresh water (lake) on the east side of it. That is truly unique and not the case in any other city in the USA. Seattle has so many things to see. I really enjoy all the major league sports it has to offer. The University of Washington also has so many sports events going on too. I'm no longer bored as I was in Portland. Not many sports, and not much to do. I guess when I would compare them, Portland is to Seattle as Spokane is to Seattle. I know I made the right move. And, as an African American, Seattle is a dream...great place to live and the people are great and so diverse. I love Seattle. Leaving Portland was the best thing I ever did. Seattle, I love you, babe! I used to like it here in the Seattle area, but not anymore. I lived in this area since 1988 and noticed in the past 3-4 years how the quality of life declined for us ordinary people but got better for the rich. I think Microsoft is mostly to blame since they bring their workers by the thousands here from other countries and from other states creating a shortage of housing. People who make less than $35K can't afford to rent even a studio apartment, not to mention buying a condo or a house even 50 miles further away. I also noticed people who pretty much serve the "higher class" by working in grocery stores, restaurants etc. are pushed out by the high prices, so now less and less people work in low paying jobs and creating longer lines in the stores. People here are getting snobbier, they are very selfish and very rude..the richer the ruder. Friends..you can make new friends, but you need to make them over and over again because friendship here doesn't last. At work, you can count on two-faced co-workers and a manager who thinks she is the queen of England. If you try to get out of the city, beware of the monster truckers who will run you down if you don't let them pass driving 80 miles in the 50 miles zone. Police nowhere unless it is ticketing time. The states of western Washington and Oregon are generally better than other regions of the country. However, the cost of living is higher. While there are employment opportunities in the high tech industry, good paying jobs for older workers are hard to find. Heading south to a warmer climate for half the year is appealing for those who can afford it. Auto traffic congestion can be a real inconvenience also. In time, it is hoped that the Seattle/Tacoma Area will achieve its plans for a more integrated rail system. Portland's light rail sytem is great in comparison to most cities around the country. Unfortunately,there is no long-term vision among government planners and officials. Efforts to get the public and private sectors to partner up in and build smart communities outside of Seattle and Portland have failed. And any thought of developing a West Coast High Speed Rail Corridor between Vancouver, BC and Eugene, with a future link to California is a waste of time. The conclusion of a Eugene Streetcar feasibility study concluded that the City has no vision or leadership, and that a broader economic strategy was needed to revitalize the community's business district. Like most towns, there's a barrier in getting around the good-old-boys, as well as corruption. I love Seattle but my views are not myopic due to the fact I have lived all over the country. Some of the comments I have read I agree with some I don’t and some are just flat out wrong. Before I dispel misconceptions, stereotypes and other biased ignorant comments, the following are some of the positives of Seattle: 1.) Seattle is the most educated and literate big city in the country, 2.) According to a number of national publications Seattle has consistently been ranked in the top five of fittest cities, 3.) City is in the top 10 greenest cities in the country, 4.) Ranked number one for big cities in Bicycling, in the top 15 for running cities, travel/leisure magazines rate it in their top 10, and 5.) Seattle is the top 3 in terms of progressive politics for minorities and women, second behind San Francisco, in terms of gay and lesbians per capita, and is well known for its liberal and accepting attitude towards interracial couples. Also of note Seattle had an African American mayor, Norm Rice, from 88-96. Ron Sims, another African American man, is King County Executive. For those who don’t know, Seattle is the county seat of King County, and the only Chinese Governor in the history of this country Gary Locke was from the Seattle area and Governor of the State of Washington for two terms. I moved to Seattle from Portland, Oregon. Pluses first...very cosmopolitan progressive city. I have found people friendly here, contrary to other posts. When there is a clear day, it is paradise. The geography is breathtakingly beautiful. Lots of trails and outdoorsy stuff to do. So if you are outdoorsy and love beautiful scenery, it is the place for you. Now the down side...EXPENSIVE! Wages do not match cost of living here. HORRIBLE TRAFFIC! I live on the Eastside and do not go into downtown Seattle unless there is a baseball game or some other perk. The horrible traffic is compounded by the lousy metro transit system which spans three counties and none of it is interconnected. So to take a bus you have to go to three different web sites. Seattle could take a clue from Portland. The bureaucracy here moves along at a snail's pace and the politicians have taken rehashing stuff over and over to a new level. Finally the WEATHER. For every clear day there is a week of gloomy, dark, rainy weather. Summer doesn't begin (using the term loosely) until mid July...if you are lucky. The past two years have been especially bad. We were able to get a fantastic deal on a house in Kirkland and both of us have steady jobs here but the TRAFFIC, WEATHER, AND EXPENSE make the Seattle area a negative big time. Would NEVER retire here. We are all entitled to our opinions. However, to say Seattle is in decay you obviously never been to cities like Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, Pittsburgh or Milwaulkie. To say Seattle is in decay you have never been to any city in California especially Socal where it resembles a third world country. Now does Seattle have issues yes are these issues being addressed yes. Whether or not the solutions will be a success in the long term whose to say but typically places that are in "decay" lose people they don't gain them i.e. Buffalo, Pittsburgh, etc... Seattle propers population is the highest in history as of 2007 and its unemployment rate is the lowest its been since 1976. The three biggest issues facing Metro Seattle are Transportation, public schools, and cost of housing. Light rail is set to go in effect in 09 and will eventually expand north and east. Seattle public school district has a new superintendant whether or not she will make improvements and get the job done is yet to be seen and as far as housing is concerned most places that are desirable will have a high cost of living. Detroit is affordable but also has a negative population growth. If I ever move to a new city it would be expected for me to adapt to the culture of the place you know when in Rome do as the Romans. Why should Seattle be any exception I moved to Seattle in 2008 and got out of there in 2010! It is over priced in everything! The housing maket is insane with what they charge! And alot of what people have posted about the people is correct! I have lived all my life in Houston, Texas. And contrary to belief Texans are not hicks! The entire time I was there I met a few friendly people! Alot of what I read from people commenting about the culture and the people not being friendly is so true! Most of the people there are more concerned about where their next organic meal will come from instead of being friendly and kind! The are very judgemental people that think they are better than eveyone else! And with the cost of living being so high the salaries are no different than Texas. Actually, your dollar goes much further in Texas! I am an educated woman that was looked down upon b/c God forbid I wanted to dress nice, color my hair and wear some make up! I've never seen so many wanna be hippies in my life! The politicians are corrupt as someone else pointed out! And don't try and find a decent church! This is the most un-christian place I have ever seen! I am so glad to be back home in the land of friendly, more reasonalbe living! Seattle you might be nice to visit from time to time with you mountains and pretty countryside.... but, you are not the place for warmth and hospitality! Straight off. Seattle wins for the sexiest US city. Gleaming skyscrapers surrounded by the Puget Sound and Lake Washington with Mt. Rainier and the Olymopia Mountains as backdrops and the Space Needle to bring something new to the skyline. Much like the rest of the area Seattle sees a lot of rain. If your blood type tests coffee than you should move to the birthplace of Starbucks. Everywhere you turn you can find a coffee shop. It's like Walmart only worse. Walmart can't be on every corner. Coffee shops can. Many great bands also have originated here; most famously Nirvana. Everyone in Seattle has at least listened to the music. As for food, the city has many restaurants, most of them stand sub-par. Seafood is abundant and you can always catch fish at the Pike Place Market which is a maze of shops and heaven for people who collect knick-knacks. There are no really good museums surprisingly considering Seattle is extremely sophisticated with most people with a degree. Crime is low and Real Estate is expensive thanks to Bill Gates and his Microsoft Corp. billionaires. Don't think it's getting better either. The job market is good considering Microsoft is present but Boeing headquartered here before moving to Chicago but jobs still remain present. If you love coffee, don't mind rain, love the outdoors and don't mind rain you better start packing! People: Please don't move here if you are black. I am in an interracial relationship and have sadly come to the conclusion that the Gentrification and isolation are very real. This is not a diverse city. It is mostly white by demographic. This is by design and can be traced back to not-so-distant times where real estate code prevented blacks and other minorities from purchasing, especially in the now hip Ballard area and other areas. The pockets left to the black folks are not growing because the cost of living is pressing in hard. Don't try to make friends, just don't. People have the most plastic, imitation relationships I have ever seen in my life. After several years, I have about two or three relationships I would call genuine, but only about 1 friend. They will be all "yeah I'm there" when they are in your presence but will immediately seem to lose sense of who you are five minutes later. It's a culture of "don't look, don't ask, don't tell, don't care" and am not referring to anything related to individuality or sexuality. I mean it. They don't care. You pull a u-turn in the middle of the highway? They won't care. Lose your job and ask your acquaintances for help, they won't care. Robber smashes a window in broad daylight? Call 911, they don't care. (You have to be either taking your junk out in public or wielding a weapon and then the police might show up). And that brings me to the next point... Wow, I googled the opposite, from Austin to Seattle. Let me tell you the differences. Summer Seattle rocks with its weather/cool temps. Other than that, Seattle is full of young punks and even older people who are very mean - I truly mean MEAN not just discourteous - compared to the loving natural culture of Texas, especially Austin. In Seattle from Austin, you see the map with all the water ... you'll never see a tad of it unless you buy a big multi-million dollar home on the water. Same as in Austin, but all the water is misleading. Traffic - a jillion times worse in Seattle - yes Austin, I really mean this! There are few freeways, or you have to use ***** boats to get your car from the really nice inexpensive homes to the city. It is a pain. There IS a football team, but the QB is a real jerk. You from Austin will love the weather, this is true if you hate sunshine. I hate sun, so this makes me happy. The business climate hugely SUCKS. It is horrible. Whatever business you are doing, expect times 10 more competitors, Seattle-ites to hate you because you are new, and do not move here unless you can live on your savings for a year or so, plus. Living expenses higher. UGLY UGLY UGLY homes in Seattle, all is ugly here including downtown. It's old, very very very UGLY. Not even close to Austin's beautiful new homes all over the place with limestone rocks and loveliness. No here, very few new any's and all even if new is very UGLY. It's a yuppie place - people are very educated here, and often work in high-technology companies in software, the internet, or high end biotec research. If you want to make friends, join a group that engages in outdoor activities, such as the Mountaineers. If you're conservative, Seattle is not for you. Go to east of the Cascade mountains if you want to be a conservative in Washington, and live in a community that is receptive towards your politics. Seattle is for hiking, mountain climbing, kayaking, skiing, sailing (under real sails, not in speedboats,) Go to art gallery openings, and demonstrate for liberal causes. I suspect that the major religion in Seattle is environmentalism. If you think Faux Spews is the best news station on the air, don't come to Seattle, or you will be shunned. Living here is expensive compared to the South or the Midwest. Land in Seattle is at a premium because it is squeezed between Puget Sound and Lake Washington. If you go very far to the east from Seattle, you are in the Cascade mountain range, which is difficult to build on. This is a mountain range that is high enough to have a number of glaciers and volcanoes. There are high mountain ranges both East and West of Seattle, covered with volcanoes, which you see over lakes and sounds. Evergreen trees are everywhere, so it is always very green. Rhododendrons, azalias, and camelias grow everywhere, as do ornamental cherry trees. All of this adds up to a city of stunning beauty. I have lived 10 minutes outside of Seattle for the past 5 years, and visit Seattle just about every weekend (I adore the Market, and the many neighborhoods). As my title states, it has not been easy for myself, or my family. As others have stated,too, it is difficult to make true friends in Seattle, and the Seattle area. So, it took three years of my trying to discover that the secret to finding friends of any sort, is to find the relo's to the area. It worked! I found out the hard way, that people who originate from the Seattle area are very polite, but that is as far as goes. They are not interested. Someone told my husband after one month of living here, that it took his wife 5 years to really make friends. I thought the man was exaggerating, but he wasn't. The only reason we are still committed to living here,is that my son has two more years of high school, and I would feel terrible moving right now. I know that no one place is perfect, I am not in search of perfection, but the passive aggressiveness that exists here is insane. And maybe it takes an outsider to really see it. It's unfortunate, because I think Seattle, and Washington state as a whole, is gorgeous,and the climate doesn't bother me at all. I love how in Western WA it really doesn't get too cold in the winter, or too hot in the summer. I really want to like living here, and I have surely tried. I suggest looking up an article for those really considering moving to Seattle, called, "The Seattle Freeze". I agree with most of the comments others have posted, and I think they are honestly accurate. I lived/worked in Seattle from 8/2006 to 1/2007. The traffic is horrible. I was flipped off on the interstates more times in one month than in the entire 26 years I lived in Ft. Worth, TX prior to moving to Seattle. Sometimes I didn't even know why I was being flipped off. Drivers would brake in front of me to irritate me, honk their horn at me several times if I did the slightest little thing they took offense to. I really was afraid I might buy a gun and kill they next guy that assaulted me on the interstates--it was that bad. However, I still do not own a gun--haha. Anyway, this is a pagan culture as others have described. The chief pagan who owns this huge software company lives here, and he seems to be adored by everyone. You can be a Christian here, but don't expect much company. The cost of living is horrendous. If you get an apartment on the eastside (Bellevue, Kirkland, Redmond) expect to pay $1,000/month with a mostly non-refundable $500 deposit. Everything is expensive--not just housing. I'll sum up and say that if you're a Microsoft wiennie making a 6-figure salary, yes maybe you will like this place. If you're a 32K/year electronics technician like myself, I give you fair warning, do not come here unless you are certain that the Lord God Himself is leading you here. Yes there are some nice things about Seattle, but the list of no-so-nice things is a far longer list. Let me wrap it up for ya: I just moved to Mountlake Terrace, a suburb of Seattle, last month, and I do not regret it one bit. Hate driving up here, but I love walking everywhere! You know what? I fit right in up here from day one. I don't want to ruin the Seattle area and/or culture; I've already embraced it long ago. I'm a long-time Mariners fan, have developed a strong interest in Seahawks football, have a very discerning taste when it comes to coffee, am fascinated by the sheer amount of cool things to do in the Seattle area, the local food and sense of community is awesome as well, Almost Live! cracks me up and is one of my favorite shows since moving up here (I swear I've seen it before...), the climate and rain suit me very well, being of Nordic / Scottish blood, the culture shift is almost non-existent as a native PNW man, and I understand the people who inhabit the area, especially the natives. I have a long-standing and deep respect for the very talented musicians from the area, especially when I was a teenager in the 90's. I was wearing flannel shirts and logging boots long before that stuff became a huge New York fashion trend, and stopped shortly after these east-coast condo-dwelling yuppies started wearing that stuff without any idea why. Before the forests shrunk in Oregon, my entire family worked out in the woods in some aspect or another, so we all dressed like that, more or less. I didn't realize that stuff was called the "grunge look" until the early 2000's. Many people come to our famous, Pike Place Market for the food, entertainment, hand made items and historical buildings. It is a great place to visit, thousands of tourists visit the market every year as well as many local come down for fun. If you are a tourist I'd like to remind you of a few things: First, Seattle is the home of many creative, original people. Since I have worked at the market, I've heard my share of rude comments on how people at the market are dressed, complaining about how a lot of locally owned businesses don't "haggle". Then the people that are for some reason rude to the sales people. First, if we don't dress how you dress, it's really none of your business. Second, a lot of people don't haggle because the product is already at it's lowest price, some people barley making money as it is. Thirdly, people who work at the market are some of the hardest working people I've ever met, if they are helping a customer and you are mad they don't get to you right away, please remember: Ever sale counts for them. They work hard and deserve some respect. Some of them work 12 hours a day, owners often 12 hours a day, seven days a week. I will also bring up how some tourist like to "poke" at the fruit. Just what we need, a line-up of fruit with finger holes in them. Be polite, and they'll be polite to you. Also-just to let you know, if you are a tourist don't kiss, or let your kids kiss the famous street pig, "Rachel", I've seen more than one time people pee on her. i've lived here almost 4 years. i make $9.72 an hour and live Comfortably in a GOOD neighborhood. a lot of people come here from 1800 square foot homes in missouri iowa and kansas that they pay like 800 a month for. they expect it to be the same here. when it's not they complain about it. if you're willing to give up the car living in a neighborhood like queen anne capital hill first hill or the central district is very easy. i pay 600 rent about 50 a month in utilities i make about 1500 a month, with no car payments it's comfortable. the two times i've gone job hunting i've had little trouble found a job within a couple weeks. i'm overweight slightly socially awkward in interviews i shake sweat and studder, i still found jobs. the people that had trouble finding jobs must have been petophiles or something. when people say very very white they mean 65% white. i'm white and i only have one white friend. most of my friends are black or asian. in my opinion white seattlites suck they're very stuck up and judgemental. they also seem to be afraid of black people. it's funny to watch some of em just stare or try to shuffle around my friends and i in an attempt not to get taken in by the dark side. if you are not insanely liberal be quiet or people will spit on you slash your tires and steal your notebook. no joke there people get jumped for being on the conservative side here. gotta love those tolerant liberal folk. the government actually listens to it's people we have to take like 4 votes on everything and nothing gets done because of it Seattle is green and beautiful. There is much to do regarding nightlife, restaurants, outdoor activities etc. There are many different neighborhoods to live and explore. It's surrounded by lakes and the Puget Sound. In a couple hours you can go to a number of places including the coast, Canada, the mountains, and Portland, OR. Mass transit is a mess here. You can always depend on a traffic mess somewhere--rain or shine. Everything has to go up for a vote which as a result, nothing ever seems to get accomplished. You're lucky if you don't have to take a vote at a four way stop sign to see who should go first. People are nice on the suface, but can be distant (aka Seattle Freeze) so making friends can take awhile. It does not rain as much as people think it does (movies depicting Seattle alway have a downpour happening). It does however get pretty grey in the winter. A beautiful Seattle summer day is worth 10 because they are amazing. But if you like your summers hot (in the 90's and above) you might not like it. Summers are generally in the upper 70's to high 80's (give and take). Unlike other regions in the country, Seattle comes alive outdoors in the city--they don't stay inside air conditioned homes. It's a great city and I've loved living here but personally I'm tired of a few downfalls like the lack of mass transit and an ever increasing housing cost. But if you do buy a place, it's probably a good investment since the housing market doesn't appear to be going down here. Worth considering, but has a cost in many other ways. Some days the city just seems broken. If you are thinking of moving here, I would highly advise against it. Seattle is or rather used to be a fantistic place to live, before "Sunset" magazine reported what a great place it was. Ever notice when someone is telling you of all the great places to live, it is never where they live? That's because it is like giving some place the "kiss of death". Yes, we do have a better than normal educated population. {After all, we've always known what a great place we were living in}. The majority of the poplation were natives and it was very friendly, yes, even to outsiders! After Sunset's artical however, it seemed like every low life, opportunistic, or developement crazy started to move here, especially Californicators and East Coast Snobs. They all talked about the terrible things they had left behind and immediatly started trying to change it back into that exact place, all the while making a dollar off of every thing in sight. Yes, we have/had wonderful a natural enviroment all around us, and the rest of the state as far as that goes, what's left that hasn't been been paved over, developed, torn down or cut down to improve view's for some over priced developement. The night life, musical enviroment and entertainment opptions were great. Several famous musicians used to visit here to relax and several other's got there start here. Prices were very affordable and many of the amenities,public and other wise were free, {I grew up on Green Lake and used to walk through Woodland Park Zoo on my way to and from school}, till outsiders started crying about what ecnomic opprotunities So here you have it, I would say that Seattle is kinda rough around the edges probably due to the fact that much of it is the lifestyle the authorities make it to-be-that-way. If and when the cops have to show up to a scene they will only assume that you should be in serious need of attention just to not waster their time or the tax-payers money, Downtown is the way it is to 1)Allow liberals to rant and rave all day and some of the night, 2)Give you a sense of being in the original Old Fashioned America (If you give someone a reason to shoot, stab or mob you, or just punch you then chances are that you did deserve it), 3)The state/ Country boarders Canada so "we have to show them WHY we are different" - of coarse that can be taken anyway you want it- not trying to be sarcastic. 4)Washington is mostly conservative (but not Seattle) so that still has a bright side meaning if you are weary of using your First Amendment then maybe you can incorporate the "second-half" of the Second Amendment to some degree and make more of a point to whoever you're trying to get a message across to. So there it is folks Seattle is just a good 'ol American town that welcomes anyone who is just tough enough to stand diversity with a little drinking of finer wine and seasonal fishing. If you're not assimilated to fishing or making friends with fishermen then do yourself a favor and accept the place for what it is because frankly I don't see people interested in changing that anytime soon, not saying you can't try. If that doesn't work then I guess you can always ask ACLU to help you on your revolution - again I'm not being sarcastic but you see what I'm saying? Seattle is possibly my favorite city in the United States, next to San Francisco. Sure, people say Seattle is too rainy, or too this, or too that, but every city has it's drawbacks and Seattle's con list is much shorter than the pro list. My older brother moved to Seattle to work for Microsoft and had trouble adjusting to the rain (we're from Las Vegas), however, he has lived there for six years now and absolutely loves it. I am planning on moving there in December when I graduate from college but I have spent summers, Christmases, And many other times in Seattle. The city it absolutely gorgeous and the rain is easy to get used to. Trust me when I say that it's much better than being caught in huge snowstorms or in the 120 degree Vegas heat. Plus, summers in Seattle are absolutely gorgeous, like nothing I've ever seen. The city is green and in bloom all the time, and well taken care of. The views on a clear day are outstanding and the area offers so much to do. My friends and family and I enjoy amazing hiking and rock climbing. My brother and I kayak in the summer and ski in the winter. We take trips to Portland and to Vancouver, to Whistler Blackcomb and to Bainbridge Island. We go wine tasting and hit some of the great restaraunts downtown. We enjoy the many pubs and plays that Seattle offers as well as some lesser known stuff like the Improv downtown. The cost of living can Be a little steep in areas, but if you simply look around, you can definitely find a nice, affordable place. I have never met anyone in Seattle that has been unfriendly or "impossible to get to know". In fact, I have more friends in Seattle than I do here in Vegas, and I don't even live there yet! All in all, I've been to a million different cities and Seattle will always have a special place in my heart as one of the greatest. having lived in Seattle nearly my whole life (40 plus years), I can tell you that it ain't what it used to be. But I can also tell you that what it is ain't that bad. Yes it is expensive. Housing (to purchase) is bad and getting worse and now even the burbs are getting expensive. Food is expensive. Restuarants are also affected by the cost of land as well as your local grocery store. Entertainment is expensive, try $100.00 for two tickets to a basketball or football game. Baseball is only marginally cheaper. Movies are 10 bucks a pop. Traffic is BAD unless you can find a way to live closer in. And as for the people...well, it will take awhile to aclimate to the local culture and make more than casual friends. The "Seattle freeze" is real. I wouldn't say we are un-friendly... we just think we have all the friends we have time for...sad when you think about it. I do it myself all the time and I can't even tell you why. Weird. Politics (in the city) are liberal... and EVERYBODY has to have their say, so very little gets done. As for spitting on conservatives, I think that most of the country has retreated to there own little corner and we no longer listen to anybody else. We are no different. It ain't as wet as sounds, but it is grey, resolutely grey all thru winter, with a few quick sunny breaks in January to teeze you then back to the clouds until April with no guarenty of consistent sun until after the 4th of July. The sidewalks no longer roll up at 9PM...but then we are back to the expensive entertainment. (I remember when the stop lights all went to flashing yellow after midnight) I don't believe we are unfriendly to kids (I have two). And it's not a bad town to be in an interracial relationship (I am) but the area is not really intermixed....unless you seek out those few neighborhoods that are. It's a great town, but is it the best?.....No, it could be better. I lived in Seattle with an interruption from 1977 to 1992 (ages 23-38) and have visited every two years or so since then to see family. It should go without saying that a person's experience depends a lot on what you put into it, but nevertheless much of what has been said here in criticism of Seattle society is true. I considered Seattle close to paradise in those early years. There was a relaxed ambience with room for adventure within the city, even for people with very little money, and a friendly live-and-let-live attitude. It was a family city, with many children and schools and neighborhoods where multiple generations had lived. Today's crowding, traffic, expense and rampant tourism in summer has destroyed that intangible sense of what it was to be a Seattleite. Children are scarce in Seattle today (I'm talking about the CITY) and becoming scarcer. Christianity is nearly an artifact, and leftist politics reigns supreme (with a substantial loony component). As for the oft-remarked coldness or rudeness, it's real but not necessarily fatal. It is of course, possible to make friends with people you do something with - just don't expect your neighbors to notice you. Expect to observe some selfish, boorish behavior (great example: the racing bicyclist who accused my 4-year old son of "spoiling my momentum"). If you are a financially comfortable, left-leaning atheist with time on your hands and an appreciation of the cultural and recreational good life, I could receommend Seattle wholeheartedly, especially if you choose and can afford to live in one of the better close-in neighborhoods. If not, you could find life in Seattle tantalizing, but frustrating and difficult, even infuriating. As for the weather, if you discount the truly gloomy months of November-January, I'd put the remaining nine months up against nine months in any other city for overall pleasantness and variety. No city in the world has nicer summers than Seattle. Don't usually write on these things but I've seen a few disparaging remarks about Seattle that I feel compelled to rebut. Clicked onto this site from another site which said Sperlings had named Seattle the 'most secure city' given the economy, crime rates, etc. Our story is that we (my wife and I) moved to Seattle in '99 to be close to her family. My first impression driving from the airport through the south Seattle industrial area on a rainy October day was... oh my god, what have we done! Then we got to our hotel downtown and my impression softened somewhat, then got on a ferry to go to an interview on Bainbridge Island and was overcome by the salt air and views and decided, yes I could live here ...now it's been ten years and I can honestly say I love, love, love this place, love it, and I cannot imagine living anywhere else, seriously. The city certainly has a wrap for non-friendliness (more aloofness really), and I gues that's because there's so much to do here that people are constantly on the move from activity to activity...whether outdoors, festivals, music scene or whatever. Though I must say my neighborhood is very friendly and we are not lacking for friends. The vibe and general culture here can be compared to no other city except maybe Austin, San Francisco, or Madison. If you are of the right-wing persuasion, you will not like it here for sure, unless you move to the eastside (Bellevue), where you will still probably be unhappy but slightly less so. If you are a progressive, you will wake up smiling every day. Note that the winter gloomy weather here is not hype, it's real, but not as bad as its made out to be. We get a lot of nice days in the winter, and it seldom gets below 25 degrees. Temps seem to hang around 40 degrees in winter, which is very cold if you're from the south (as I am). Learn to ski and you begin to look forward to it though. The summer here is better than any place on earth, no exageration. The quality of life, all things considered, is excellent. I'm sorry some people posting comments have had a bad experience, I think that is not the norm. My grandparents on both side were immigrants to Washington in the very early 1900s. My parents grew up in Seattle before most people from other states had ever heard of it. Before the 70's I think Seattle could be characterized as more of a blue-collared medium-sized town that Boeing (and Weyerhauser) had built. Yet, being on the Pacific Rim had always kept the town/people open to other cultures, to travel, and to higher education (after all, the immigrants and settlers worked hard so their children could have a better life). Traffic was snarl-free up until the 90's. People were friendly, open, curious, polite, although a little reserved (hey, with many having Scandinavian and Asian roots, what do you expect?). As transplants came into the area because they loved our cheap housing (compared to other bigger West coast cities, at the time, from the 80's on), our scenery, and the year-around activities, they brought with them their arrogance. The Seattleites my generations of family grew up with did not experience any of the bad traits characterized in all of the blogs I have read on this site. I have lived in other countries and other big cities, and still love this area. But, the neighborhoods that have become "hip" (and those with the highest price tags) do feel like what is portrayed by you others. But the modest, still hard-working, non-"hip" neighborhoods in the other parts of the city and counties, will reveal some of the friendliness and good qualities I and my family grew up with. Incidentally, I have lived in NE Seattle, NW Seattle, SE Seattle, and the Eastside, including rural King County. I am a graduate of the University of Washington, have lived and travelled in Europe and in Asia (so I think I can speak fairly objectively). I wonder if some new transplants realize that sometimes, some Seattleites are so busy experiencing outdoor activities (hiking, biking, camping, sailing) that they don't make time for the more traditional "hospitality" acts that maybe people from other parts of the country expect? Not passing judgement on either side, but just making an observation. My grandparents on both sides were immigrants to Washington in the very early 1900s. My parents grew up in Seattle before most people from other states had ever heard of it. Before the 70's I think Seattle could be characterized as more of a blue-collared medium-sized town that Boeing (and Weyerhauser) had built.

The Seattleites my generations of family grew up with did not experience any of the bad traits characterized in all of the blogs I have read on this site. I have lived in other countries and in/near other big cities, and still love this area. But, the neighborhoods that have become "hip" (and those with the highest price tags) do feel like they have become what is portrayed here. However, in the modest, still hard-working, non-"hip" neighborhoods in the other parts of the city and outlying neighborhoods, you will find some of the friendliness and good qualities I and my family grew up with. Incidentally, I have lived 1 mile from downtown, in NE Seattle, NW Seattle, SE Seattle, and the Eastside, including rural King County. I am a graduate of the University of Washington, have lived and travelled in Europe and in Asia (so I think I can speak fairly objectively). I wonder if some new transplants realize that sometimes, some Seattleites are so busy experiencing outdoor activities (hiking, biking, camping, sailing) that they don't make time for the more traditional "hospitality" acts that maybe people from other parts of the country expect? Not passing judgement on either side, but just making an observation. What am I talking about? INTIMIDATION! There is a obvious style of promoting fear and at the least,stress promoting dress and behavior. I have had conversation with many friends and aquaintances that believe the same. What is this style or behavior? Take a good hard evaluation look at what INTIMIDATION dress and behavior is in this community....Dark sunglasses at night (not the blind) hooded sweat clothes, jackets in black (pulled up over heads) during hot weather, crotch grabbing while looking directly into bystanders eyes without expression, just a stare. Language from our youth (10-25) speaking *&%^#@*&**%#! in a Theatre, Mall, School, Restaurant etc. without the slightest concern for anyone within hearing distance, including young children and elderly, or anyone. Why do we not say something when we hear the "F word, the "B" word, the "N" word, or any of the "Words" that are offensive? Everyone recognizes INTIMIDATION behavior, but because of either a misguided interpretation of "Individual expression of personal preferences" or just plain FEAR, we look the other way and just allow the INTIMIDATION to continue. What does this do to our friendly open expression of living? Well it minimizes greetings, politeness, thankfulness and general human kindness. How, just take a look at what verbal communication goes on when there are "INTIMIDATERS" standing at social events such as Sports, Arts, Education, Music events promote. Redirecting eyecontact, walking paths, entrances to venues and actually making a decision "NOT" to go someplace because of what "Might" happen because of feeling the Intimidation projected by the few. I am a firm believer and promoter of individual freedoms. I have and will fight for the rights of freedom of personal belefs and goals. What is obvious to everyone is what the few are doing with this freedom in the Seattle area..It doesn't take a genious to recognize how much this area has declined from a friendly, open communication, free traveling neighborhood enviornment to a suspecios, fearful, protective jungle. It starts at home with the family, what we promote and tolerate is what becomes the adult standard. We all need to take our society back from the INTIMIDATORS. The 'culture' here is proudly, smugly, hard-Left. I'm not talking about what passes for 'liberalism' in most other places; I'm talking about a near-Stalinist culture that adores having an actual statue of Lenin within the City limits. I'm talking about not being able to put a non-Leftist political bumper sticker on your car or a non-Leftist political yard sign in front of your house at election times because your car "will" be vandalized if you park it on the street and your home will be vandalized as well. I'm talking about Black Lives Matter yard signs and about my home being the only one in about a twenty-block radius flying an American flag on the Fourth Of July or Veteran's Day. I'm talking about continuously re-electing people like Jim McDermott and Patty Murray, and with the loudest voices complaining that they are not far-enough to the Left, and so an openly and proudly Socialist candidate was elected to the Seattle City Council. I'm talking about being SCREAMED at for politely holding the door open for someone at the U of W campus because you're 'oppressing' her and you're a misogynist for employing such a traditional courtesy. I've had that happen multiple times. At social events, club meetings, cocktail parties, etc. people will automatically assume that you're on the Left and will accept that as a given, starting conversations with you under that assumption. It seems that 'everything' is about politics....as an example, my mother, who also lives within the City, loves gardening and she wanted to learn how to be a better gardener. She thought that it would be appropriate to join a gardening club. She joined one of the larger ones in the area and they were friendly enough at the outset but as time went on they dropped the pretense of being a gardening club and spent all their time talking politics from a VERY hard-Left perspective. After months of this she left the club in disgust...she grew tired of feeling that she had to sit in a corner like a mouse while everyone else talked exclusively about politics. So much else is similar to that around here....I had the same experience at a bicycle club, and 'office politics' take on an entirely new dimension. If you're not on the hard Left, it's best to stay quiet when discussions of current events come up, otherwise you'll find yourself very much alone at the workplace and possibly without a job, depending upon where you work. If you are thinking of moving here, I would highly advise against it. Seattle is or rather used to be a fantistic place to live, before "Sunset" magazine reported what a great place it was. Ever notice when someone is telling you of all the great places to live, it is never where they live? That's because it is like giving some place the "kiss of death". Yes, we do have a better than normal educated population. {After all, we've always known what a great place we were living in}. The majority of the poplation were natives and it was very friendly, yes, even to outsiders! After Sunset's artical however, it seemed like every low life, opportunistic, or developement crazy started to move here, especially Californicators and East Coast Snobs. They all talked about the terrible things they had left behind and immediatly started trying to change it back into that exact place, all the while making a dollar off of every thing in sight. Yes, we have/had wonderful a natural enviroment all around us, and the rest of the state as far as that goes, what's left that hasn't been been paved over, developed, torn down or cut down to improve view's for some over priced developement. The night life, musical enviroment and entertainment opptions were great. Several famous musicians used to visit here to relax and several other's got there start here. Prices were very affordable and many of the amenities,public and other wise were free, {I grew up on Green Lake and used to walk through Woodland Park Zoo on my way to and from school}, till outsiders started crying about what ecnomic opportunities were going to waste and how all the housing and land were underpriced, I used to own a rental and every time I put it up for rent I had several calls wanting to buy it or manage it by raising the price. There are so many reasons I would advise against moving here, expenses, food, housing, transportation and there are not as many jobs as they would like you to believe, we are an labor union state, and a still primarily democratic population. So if you want to come here to change us or to turn us into New York or L.A. or to make your fortune by walking over others don't bother you're not going to be happy and it's probably not for you. And if you don't want to be told to back where you came from, change your license plates and don't brag about how great it was back there. As a lot of natives will tell you, "If you don't like it here, why don't you go the hell back where you came from?", and we've gotten so we're not too shy about it, either. Good luck finding a place you love. Somewhere else!! #NAME?
